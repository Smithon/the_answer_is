in physics motion is a change in position of an object with respect to time motion is typically described in terms of displacement distance (scalar) velocity acceleration time and speed motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame
if the position of a body is not changing with the time with respect to a given frame of reference the body is said to be at rest motionless immobile stationary or to have constant (time-invariant) position an object's motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force as described by newton's first law momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring motion of an object an object's momentum is directly related to the object's mass and velocity and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time as described by the law of conservation of momentum
as there is no absolute frame of reference absolute motion cannot be determined thus everything in the universe can be considered to be moving
more generally motion is a concept that applies to objects bodies and matter particles to radiation radiation fields and radiation particles and to space its curvature and space-time one can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries so the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system for example one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions
== laws of motionedit ==
in physics motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics motions of all large scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as projectiles planets cells and humans) are described by classical mechanics whereas the motion of very small atomic and sub-atomic objects is described by quantum mechanics
=== classical mechanicsedit ===
classical mechanics is used for describing the motion of macroscopic objects from projectiles to parts of machinery as well as astronomical objects such as spacecraft planets stars and galaxies it produces very accurate results within these domains and is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science engineering and technology
classical mechanics is fundamentally based on newton's laws of motion these laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body they were first compiled by sir isaac newton in his work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica first published on july 5 1687 his three laws are:
a body either is at rest or moves with constant velocity until and unless an outer force is applied to it
an object will travel in one direction only until an outer force changes its direction
whenever one body exerts a force f onto a second body,(in some cases which is standing still) the second body exerts the force f on the first body f and f are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense so the body which exerts f will go backwards
newton's three laws of motion along with his newton's law of motion which were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding orbiting bodies in outer space this explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth
classical mechanics was later further enhanced by albert einstein's special relativity and general relativity motion of objects with a high velocity approaching the speed of light; general relativity is employed to handle gravitational motion at a deeper level
=== quantum mechanicsedit ===
quantum mechanics is a set of principles describing physical reality at the atomic level of matter (molecules and atoms) and the subatomic (electrons protons and even smaller particles) these descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both matter and radiation energy this is described in the waveparticle duality
in classical mechanics accurate measurements and predictions of the state of objects can be calculated such as location and velocity in the quantum mechanics due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle) the complete state of a subatomic particle such as its location and velocity cannot be simultaneously determined
in addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large scale phenomenon such as superfluidity superconductivity and biological systems including the function of smell receptors and the structures of proteins
== list of "imperceptible" human motionsedit ==
humans like all known things in the universe are in constant motion however aside from obvious movements of the various external body parts and locomotion humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to perceive many of these "imperceptible motions" are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation the larger scales of "imperceptible motions" are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons: 1) newton's laws of motion (particularly inertia) which prevent humans from feeling motions of a mass to which they are connected and 2) the lack of an obvious frame of reference which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving the smaller scales of these motions are too small for humans to sense
=== universeedit ===
spacetime (the fabric of the universe) is actually expanding essentially everything in the universe is stretching like a rubber band this motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such but rather a change in the very nature of the universe the primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by edwin hubble who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us ("hubble's law") as predicted by a universal expansion
=== galaxyedit ===
the milky way galaxy is moving through space many astronomers believe the milky way is moving at approximately 600 km/s relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background this frame of reference indicates that the milky way is moving at around 552 km/s
=== sun and solar systemedit ===
the milky way is rotating around its dense galactic center thus the sun is moving in a circle within the galaxy's gravity away from the central bulge or outer rim the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240 km/s all planets and their moons move with the sun thus the solar system is moving
=== earthedit ===
the earth is rotating or spinning around its axis this is evidenced by day and night at the equator the earth has an eastward velocity of 0.4651 km/s (1040 mi/h)
the earth is orbiting around the sun in an orbital revolution a complete orbit around the sun takes one year or about 365 days; it averages a speed of about 30 km/s (67,000 mi/h)
=== continentsedit ===
the theory of plate tectonics tells us that the continents are drifting on convection currents within the mantle causing them to move across the surface of the planet at the slow speed of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) per year however the velocities of plates range widely the fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/yr (3.0 in/yr) and the pacific plate moving 5269 mm/yr (2.12.7 in/yr) at the other extreme the slowest-moving plate is the eurasian plate progressing at a typical rate of about 21 mm/yr (0.8 in/yr)
=== internal bodyedit ===
the human heart is constantly contracting to move blood throughout the body through larger veins and arteries in the body blood has been found to travel at approximately 0.33 m/s though considerable variation exists and peak flows in the venae cavae have been found between 0.1 m/s and 0.45 m/s
the smooth muscles of hollow internal organs are moving the most familiar would be peristalsis which is where digested food is forced throughout the digestive tract though different foods travel through the body at rates an average speed through the human small intestine is 2.16 m/h (0.036 m/s)
typically some sound is audible at any given moment when the vibration of these sound waves reaches the ear drum it moves in response and allows the sense of hearing
the human lymphatic system is constantly moving excess fluids lipids and immune system related products around the body the lymph fluid has been found to move through a lymph capillary of the skin at approximately 0.0000097 m/s
=== cellsedit ===
the cells of the human body have many structures which move throughout them
cytoplasmic streaming is a way which cells move molecular substances throughout the cytoplasm
various motor proteins work as molecular motors within a cell and move along the surface of various cellular substrates such as microtubuless motor proteins are typically powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (atp) and convert chemical energy into mechanical work vesicles propelled by motor proteins have been found to have a velocity of approximately 0.00000152 m/s
=== particlesedit ===
according to the laws of thermodynamics all particles of matter are in constant random motion as long as the temperature is above absolute zero thus the molecules and atoms which make up the human body are vibrating colliding and moving this motion can be detected as temperature; higher temperatures which represent greater kinetic energy in the particles feel warm to humans whom sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves similarly when lower temperature objects are touched the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold
=== subatomic particlesedit ===
within each atom electrons exist in an area around the nucleus this area is called the electron cloud according to bohr's model of the atom electrons have a high velocity and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move if electrons 'move' about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light however there is no reason that one must confine one's self to this strict conceptualization that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do rather one can conceptualize electrons to be 'particles' that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud
inside the atomic nucleus the protons and neutrons are also probably moving around due the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of angular momentum of both particles
== lightedit ==
light propagates at 299,792,458 m/s often approximated as 300,000 kilometres per second or 186,000 miles per second the speed of light (or c) is also the speed of all massless particles and associated fields in a vacuum and it is the upper limit on the speed at which energy matter and information can travel the speed of light is the limit speed for physical systems
in addition the speed of light is an invariant quantity: it has the same value irrespective of the position or speed of the observer this property makes the speed of light c the natural measurement unit for speed
