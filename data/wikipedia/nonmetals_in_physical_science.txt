in chemistry a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a chemical element that mostly lacks metallic attributes physically nonmetals tend to be highly volatile (easily vaporised) have low elasticity and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically they tend to have high ionization energy and electronegativity values and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen helium nitrogen oxygen fluorine neon chlorine argon krypton xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine); and a few are solids (carbon phosphorus sulfur selenium and iodine)
moving rightward across the standard form of the periodic table nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours as is the case (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite) or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur diatomic nonmetals such as hydrogen have one nearest neighbour and the monatomic noble gases such as helium have none this gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character the distinction between the three categories of nonmetals in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct hybrid-like or atypical properties
although five times more elements are metals than nonmetals two of the nonmetalshydrogen and heliummake up over 99 per cent of the observable universe and oneoxygenmakes up close to half of the earth's crust oceans and atmosphere living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals
== definition and properties ==
there is no rigorous definition of a nonmetal they show more variability in their properties than do metals the following are some of the chief characteristics of nonmetals physically they largely exist as monatomic gases with a few having more substantial (but still open-packed) diatomic or polyatomic forms unlike metals which are nearly all solid and close-packed; if solid they generally have a submetallic or dull appearance and are brittle as opposed to metals which are lustrous ductile or malleable; they usually have lower densities than metals; are poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of metals (with the exception of carbon) chemically the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with metals unlike metals which form alloys; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the metals are basic
== applicable elements ==
the elements generally classified as nonmetals include one element in group 1 (hydrogen); one in group 14 (carbon); two in group 15 (nitrogen and phosphorus); three in group 16 (oxygen sulfur and selenium); most of group 17 (fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine); and all of group 18 (with the possible exception of ununoctium)
the distinction between nonmetals and metals is by no means clear the result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids or vice versa for example selenium (se) a nonmetal is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (at) which is a metalloid and a halogen is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal
== categories ==
nonmetals have structures in which each atom usually forms (8 n) bonds with (8 n) nearest neighbours where n is the number of valence electrons each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration exceptions to the (8 n) rule occur with hydrogen (which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell) carbon nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative (more stable) bonding structures with fewer nearest neighbours thus carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds respectively the larger size of the remaining non-noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms sulfur for example forms an eight-membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms
from left to right across the standard form of periodic table as metallic character decreases nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction in the numbers of nearest neighboursthree or two for the polyatomic nonmetals through one for the diatomic nonmetals to zero for the monatomic noble gases a similar pattern occurs more generally at the level of the entire periodic table in comparing metals and nonmetals there is a transition from metallic bonding amongst the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or van der waals (electrostatic) bonding amongst the nonmetals on the right of the table metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours post-transition metals and metalloids sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours nonmetallic bonding towards the right of the table features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours as noted this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases is mirrored among the nonmetals the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic to diatomic to monatomic
as is the case with the major categories of metals metalloids and nonmetals there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal among the polyatomic nonmetals carbon phosphorus and seleniumwhich border the metalloidsbegin to show some metallic character sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals) is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below) of the diatomic nonmetals iodine is the most metallic its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal within the iodine molecule significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom and these interactions give rise in bulk iodine to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties of the monatomic nometals radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour which is unusual for a nonmetal
=== polyatomic nonmetals ===
four nonmetals are distinguished by polyatomic bonding in their standard states in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (c as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as p4 molecules); sulfur (as s8 molecules); and selenium (se as helical chains) consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3) the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; they are all solid mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.192.58) sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance brittle comportment and low conductivityattributes common to all sulfur allotropes it nevertheless shows some metallic character either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (snx)
the polyatomic nonmetals are distinguished from the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers higher melting points (in their thermodynamically most stable forms) and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility more generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds the ability of carbon to catenate in particular is fundamental to the field of organic chemistry and life on earth all of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids and all are known in either malleable pliable or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals
=== diatomic nonmetals ===
seven nonmetals exist as diatomic molecules in their standard states: hydrogen (h2); nitrogen (n2); oxygen (o2); fluorine (f2); chlorine (cl2); bromine (br2); and iodine (i2) they are generally highly insulating highly electronegative non-reflective gases noting that bromine a liquid and iodine a solid are both volatile at room temperature exceptions to this generalised description occur at the boundaries of the category: hydrogen has a comparatively low electronegativity due to its unique atomic structure; iodine in crystalline form is semi-lustrous and a semiconductor in the direction of its layers both of these attributes being consistent with incipient metallic character
the diatomic nonmetals are distinguished from the polyatomic nonmetals by virtue of having lower coordination numbers lower melting points (compared to the polyatomic nonmetals in their thermodynamically most stable forms) and lower boiling points; and having narrower liquid ranges and greater room temperature volatility more generally they show less inclination to exist in allotropic forms and to catenate; and have a stronger ability to form hydrogen bonds most are also gases and have higher ionisation energies and higher electronegativities than those of the polyatomic nonmetals
=== noble gases ===
six nonmetals occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: helium (he) neon (ne) argon (ar) krypton (kr) xenon (xe) and the radioactive radon (rn) they comprise a group of chemical elements with very similar properties in their standard states they are all colorless odourless nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity
with their closed valence shells the noble gases have the highest first ionization potentials in each of their periods and feeble interatomic forces of attraction with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points that is why they are all gases under standard conditions even those with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements
the status of the period 7 congener of the noble gases element 118 (temporary name ununoctium) is not knownit may or may not be a noble gas it was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential due to relativistic effects on the other hand if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112 copernicium (as is thought to be the case) element 118 may turn out to be a noble gas after all albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon
=== elemental gases ===
hydrogen nitrogen oxygen fluorine chlorine plus the noble gases are collectively referred to as the elemental gases these elements are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (stp) they are also distinguished by having the lowest densities lowest melting and boiling points strongest insulating properties and highest electronegativity and ionization energy values in the periodic table
it is not known if any synthetic elements with atomic number above 99 are gases if it transpires that copernicium and flerovium are gaseous metals at or near room temperature as some calculations have suggested the category of elemental gases may need to be sub-divided into metallic and nonmetallic gases
=== organogens chonps and biogens ===
carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur are sometimes referred to or categorised as organogens chonps elements or biogens collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on earth they are further distinguishedin comparison to the halogens (f cl br i at) and noble gasesby their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides
=== other nonmetals ===
selenium and possibly boron silicon arsenic and tellurium plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals the first five of these (se; b si as te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong rather than weak acidic hydride
== comparison of properties ==
characteristic and other properties of polyatomic nonmetals diatomic nonmetals and the monatomic noble gases are summarized in the following table physical properties are listed in loose order of ease of determination; chemical properties run from general to specific and then to descriptive
== allotropes ==
many nonmetals have less stable allotropes with either nonmetallic or metallic properties graphite the standard state of carbon has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor the diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic however being translucent and having a relatively poor electrical conductivity carbon is also known in several other allotropic forms including semiconducting buckminsterfullerene (c60) nitrogen can form gaseous tetranitrogen (n4) an unstable polyatomic molecule with a lifetime of about one microsecond oxygen is a diatomic molecule in its standard state; it also exists as ozone (o3) an unstable polyatomic nonmetallic allotrope with a half-life of around half an hour phosphorus uniquely exists in several allotropic forms that are more stable than that of its standard state as white phosphorus (p4) the red and black allotropes are probably the best known; both are semiconductors; black phosphorus in addition has a lustrous appearance phosphorus is also known as diphosphorus (p2) an unstable diatomic allotrope sulfur has more allotropes than any other element; all of these except plastic sulfur (a metastable ductile mixture of allotropes) have nonmetallic properties selenium has several nonmetallic allotropes all of which are much less electrically conducting than its standard state of grey "metallic" selenium iodine is also known in a semiconducting amorphous form under sufficiently high pressures just over half of the nonmetals starting with phosphorus at 1.7 gpa have been observed to form metallic allotropes
== abundance and extraction ==
hydrogen and helium are estimated to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe less than five per cent of the universe is believed to be made of ordinary matter represented by stars planets and living beings the balance is made of dark energy and dark matter both of which are poorly understood at present
hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen constitute the great bulk of the earth's atmosphere oceans crust and biosphere; the remaining nonmetals have abundances of 0.5 per cent or less in comparison 35 per cent of the crust is made up of the metals sodium magnesium aluminium potassium and iron; together with a metalloid silicon all other metals and metalloids have abundances within the crust oceans or biosphere of 0.2 per cent or less
nonmetals in their elemental forms are extracted from: brine: cl br i; liquid air: n o ne ar kr xe; minerals: c (coal; diamond; graphite); f (fluorite); p ( phosphates); i (in sodium iodate naio3 and sodium iodide nai); natural gas: h he s; and from ores as processing byproducts: se (especially copper ores); and rn (uranium bearing ores)
== applications in common ==
for prevalent and speciality applications of individual nonmetals see the main article for each element
nonmetals do not have any universal or near-universal applications this is not the case with metals most of which have structural uses; nor the metalloids the typical uses of which extend to (for example) oxide glasses alloying components and semiconductors
shared applications of different subsets of the nonmetals instead encompass their presence in or specific uses in the fields of: cryogenics and refrigerants: h he n o f and ne; fertilisers: h n p s cl (as a micronutrient) and se; household accoutrements: h (primary constituent of water) he (party balloons) c (in pencils as graphite) n (beer widgets) o (as peroxide in detergents) f (as fluoride in toothpaste) ne (lighting) p (matches) s (garden treatments) cl (bleach constituent) ar (insulated windows) se (glass; solar cells) br (as bromide for purification of spa water) kr (energy saving fluorescent lamps) i (in antiseptic solutions) xe (in plasma tv display cells) and rn (as an unwanted potentially hazardous indoor pollutant); industrial acids: c n f p s and cl; inert air replacements: n ne s (in sulfur hexafluoride sf6) ar kr and xe; lasers and lighting: he c (in carbon dioxide lasers co2) n o (in a chemical oxygen iodine laser) f (in a hydrogen fluoride laser hf) ne s (in a sulfur lamp) ar kr and xe; and medicine and pharmaceuticals: he o f cl br i xe and rn
the number of compounds formed by nonmetals is vast the first nine places in a "top 20" table of elements most frequently encountered in 8,427,300 compounds as listed in the chemical abstracts service register for july 1987 were occupied by nonmetals hydrogen carbon oxygen and nitrogen were found in the majority (greater than 64 per cent) of compounds the highest rated metal with an occurrence frequency of 2.3 per cent was iron in 11th place

=== antiquity: c s ===
sulfur and carbon were known in antiquity the earliest known use of charcoal dates to around 3750 bce the egyptians and sumerians employed it for the reduction of copper zinc and tin ores in the manufacture of bronze diamonds were probably known from as early as 2500 bce the first true chemical analyses were made in the 18th century; lavoisier recognized carbon as an element in 1789 sulfur usage dates from before 2500 bce; it was recognized as an element by antoine lavoisier in 1777

phosphorus was prepared from urine by hennig brand in 1669 it was the first element to be chemically discovered
=== 18th century: h o n cl ===
cavendish in 1766 was the first to distinguish hydrogen from other gases although paracelsus around 1500 robert boyle (1670) and joseph priestley {?) had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals lavoisier named it in 1793 carl wilhelm scheele obtained oxygen by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771 but did not publish his findings until 1777 priestley also prepared this new "air" by 1774 but only lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777 rutherford discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the university of edinburgh he showed that the air in which animals breathed after removal of exhaled carbon dioxide was no longer able to burn a candle scheele henry cavendish and priestley also studied this element at about the same time; lavoisier named it in 1775-6 scheele obtained chlorine from hydrochloric acid but thought it was an oxide only in 1808 did humphry davy recognize it as an element
=== early 19th century: i se br ===
courtois in 1811 discovered iodine in the ashes of seaweed in 1817 when berzelius and johan gottlieb gahn were working with lead they discovered a substance that reminded of tellurium after more investigation berzelius concluded that it was a new element related to sulfur and tellurium because of tellurium has been named for the earth berzelius named the new element "selenium" after the moon balard and gmelin both discovered bromine in the autumn of 1825 and published their results in the following year
=== late 19th century: he f ar kr ne xe rn ===
in 1868 janssen and lockyer independently observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match that of any other element in 1895 in each case at around the same time ramsay cleve and langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite andr-marie ampre predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it fluorine was eventually isolated by moissan in 1886 in 1894 lord rayleigh and ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means it was the first noble gas to be isolated in 1898 within a period of three weeks ramsay and travers successively separated krypton neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points in 1898 dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; ramsay and robert whytlaw-gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910
