in chemistry the mole fraction or molar fraction () is defined as the amount of a constituent (expressed in moles)  divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture :
the sum of all the mole fractions is equal to 1:
the same concept expressed with a denominator of 100 is the mole percent or molar percentage or molar proportion (mol%)
the mole fraction is also called the amount fraction it is identical to the number fraction which is defined as the number of molecules of a constituent divided by the total number of all molecules  the mole fraction is sometimes denoted by the lowercase greek letter (chi) instead of a roman  for mixtures of gases iupac recommends the letter 
the national institute of standards and technology of the united states prefers the term amount-of-substance fraction over mole fraction because it does not contain the name of the unit mole
whereas mole fraction is a ratio of moles to moles molar concentration is a ratio of moles to volume
the mole fraction is one way of expressing the composition of a mixture with a dimensionless quantity; mass fraction (percentage by weight wt%) and volume fraction (percentage by volume vol%) are others
== propertiesedit ==
mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams it has a number of advantages:
it is not temperature dependent (such as molar concentration) and does not require knowledge of the densities of the phase(s) involved
a mixture of known mole fraction can be prepared by weighing off the appropriate masses of the constituents
the measure is symmetric: in the mole fractions x=0.1 and x=0.9 the roles of 'solvent' and 'solute' are reversed
in a mixture of ideal gases the mole fraction can be expressed as the ratio of partial pressure to total pressure of the mixture

=== mass fractionedit ===
the mass fraction can be calculated using the formula
where is the molar mass of the component and is the average molar mass of the mixture
replacing the expression of the molar mass:
=== mole percentageedit ===
multiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage also referred as amount/amount percent (abbreviated as n/n%)
=== mass concentrationedit ===
the conversion to and from mass concentration is given by:
where is the average molar mass of the mixture
=== molar concentrationedit ===
the conversion to molar concentration is given by:
or
where is the average molar mass of the solution c total molar concentration and is the density of the solution 
=== mass and molar massedit ===
the mole fraction can be calculated from the masses and molar masses of the components:
== spatial variation and gradientedit ==
in a spatially non-uniform mixture the mole fraction gradient triggers the phenomenon of diffusion
