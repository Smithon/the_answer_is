atomism (from greek  atomon i.e "uncuttable" "indivisible") is a natural philosophy that developed in several ancient traditions the atomists theorized that nature consists of two fundamental principles: atom and void unlike their modern scientific namesake in atomic theory philosophical atoms come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes each indestructible immutable and surrounded by a void where they collide with the others or hook together forming a cluster clusters of different shapes arrangements and positions give rise to the various macroscopic substances in the world
references to the concept of atomism and its atoms are found in ancient india and ancient greece in india the jain ajivika and carvaka schools of atomism may date back to the 4th century bce the nyaya and vaisheshika schools later developed theories on how atoms combined into more complex objects in the west atomism emerged in the 5th century bce with leucippus and democritus whether indian culture influenced greek or vice versa or whether both evolved independently is a matter of dispute
the particles of chemical matter for which chemists and other natural philosophers of the early 19th century found experimental evidence were thought to be indivisible and therefore were given the name "atom" long used by the atomist philosophy
however in the 20th century the "atoms" of the chemists were found to be composed of even smaller entities: electrons neutrons and protons and further experiments showed that protons and neutrons are made of quarks although the connection to historical atomism is at best tenuous elementary particles have thus become a modern analog of philosophical atoms despite the misnomer in chemistry
== reductionism ==
philosophical atomism is a reductive argument: not only that everything is composed of atoms and void but that nothing they compose really exists: the only things that really exist are atoms ricocheting off each other mechanistically in an otherwise empty void atomism stands in contrast to a substance theory wherein a prime material continuum remains qualitatively invariant under division (for example the ratio of the four classical elements would be the same in any portion of a homogeneous material)
indian buddhists such as dharmakirti and others also developed distinctive theories of atomism for example involving momentary (instantaneous) atoms that flash in and out of existence (kalapas)
== greek atomism ==
in the 5th century bc leucippus and his pupil democritus proposed that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms in order to reconcile two conflicting schools of thought on the nature of reality on one side was heraclitus who believed that the nature of all existence is change on the other side was parmenides who believed instead that all change is illusion
parmenides denied the existence of motion change and void he believed all existence to be a single all-encompassing and unchanging mass (a concept known as monism) and that change and motion were mere illusions this conclusion as well as the reasoning that led to it may indeed seem baffling to the modern empirical mind but parmenides explicitly rejected sensory experience as the path to an understanding of the universe and instead used purely abstract reasoning firstly he believed there is no such thing as void equating it with non-being (i.e "if the void is then it is not nothing; therefore it is not the void") this in turn meant that motion is impossible because there is no void to move into he also wrote all that is must be an indivisible unity for if it were manifold then there would have to be a void that could divide it (and he did not believe the void exists) finally he stated that the all encompassing unity is unchanging for the unity already encompasses all that is and can be
democritus accepted most of parmenides' arguments except for the idea that change is an illusion he believed change was real and if it was not then at least the illusion had to be explained he thus supported the concept of void and stated that the universe is made up of many parmenidean entities that move around in the void the void is infinite and provides the space in which the atoms can pack or scatter differently the different possible packings and scatterings within the void make up the shifting outlines and bulk of the objects that organisms feel see eat hear smell and taste while organisms may feel hot or cold hot and cold actually have no real existence they are simply sensations produced in organisms by the different packings and scatterings of the atoms in the void that compose the object that organisms sense as being "hot" or "cold"
the work of democritus only survives in secondhand reports some of which are unreliable or conflicting much of the best evidence of democritus' theory of atomism is reported by aristotle in his discussions of democritus' and plato's contrasting views on the types of indivisibles composing the natural world
=== geometry and atoms ===
plato (c 427 c 347 bc) were he familiar with the atomism of democritus would have objected to its mechanistic materialism he argued that atoms just crashing into other atoms could never produce the beauty and form of the world in plato's timaeus (28b 29a) the character of timeaus insisted that the cosmos was not eternal but was created although its creator framed it after an eternal unchanging model
one part of that creation were the four simple bodies of fire air water and earth but plato did not consider these corpuscles to be the most basic level of reality for in his view they were made up of an unchanging level of reality which was mathematical these simple bodies were geometric solids the faces of which were in turn made up of triangles the square faces of the cube were each made up of four isosceles right-angled triangles and the triangular faces of the tetrahedron octahedron and icosahedron were each made up of six right-angled triangles
he postulated the geometric structure of the simple bodies of the four elements as summarized in the table to the right the cube with its flat base and stability was assigned to earth; the tetrahedron was assigned to fire because its penetrating points and sharp edges made it mobile the points and edges of the octahedron and icosahedron were blunter and so these less mobile bodies were assigned to air and water since the simple bodies could be decomposed into triangles and the triangles reassembled into atoms of different elements plato's model offered a plausible account of changes among the primary substances
=== the rejection of atoms ===
sometime before 330 bc aristotle asserted that the elements of fire air earth and water were not made of atoms but were continuous aristotle considered the existence of a void which was required by atomic theories to violate physical principles change took place not by the rearrangement of atoms to make new structures but by transformation of matter from what it was in potential to a new actuality a piece of wet clay when acted upon by a potter takes on its potential to be an actual drinking mug aristotle has often been criticized for rejecting atomism but in ancient greece the atomic theories of democritus remained "pure speculations incapable of being put to any experimental test granted that atomism was in the long run to prove far more fruitful than any qualitative theory of matter in the short run the theory that aristotle proposed must have seemed in some respects more promising"
=== later ancient atomism ===
epicurus (341270) studied atomism with nausiphanes who had been a student of democritus although epicurus was certain of the existence of atoms and the void he was less sure we could adequately explain specific natural phenomena such as earthquakes lightning comets or the phases of the moon (lloyd 1973 256) few of epicurus's writings survive and those that do reflect his interest in applying democritus's theories to assist people in taking responsibility for themselves and for their own happinesssince he held there are no gods around that can help them he understood gods' role as moral ideals
his ideas are also represented in the works of his follower lucretius who wrote on the nature of things this scientific work in poetic form illustrates several segments of epicurean theory on how the universe came into its current stage and it shows that the phenomena we perceive are actually composite forms the atoms and the void are eternal and in constant motion atomic collisions create objects which are still composed of the same eternal atoms whose motion for a while is incorporated into the created entity human sensations and meteorological phenomena are also explained by lucretius in terms of atomic motion
=== atomism and ethics ===
some later philosophers attributed the idea that man created gods; the gods did not create man to democritus for example sextus empiricus noted:
some people think that we arrived at the idea of gods from the remarkable things that happen in the world democritus  says that the people of ancient times were frightened by happenings in the heavens such as thunder lightning  and thought that they were caused by gods
three hundred years after epicurus lucretius in his epic poem on the nature of things would depict him as the hero who crushed the monster religion through educating the people in what was possible in the atoms and what was not possible in the atoms however epicurus expressed a non-aggressive attitude characterized by his statement: "the man who best knows how to meet external threats makes into one family all the creatures he can; and those he can not he at any rate does not treat as aliens; and where he finds even this impossible he avoids all dealings and so far as is advantageous excludes them from his life." [1]
== indian atomism ==
the indian atomistic position like many movements in indian philosophy and mathematics starts with an argument from linguistics the vedic etymologist and grammarian yaska (c 7th century bc) in his nirukta in dealing with models for how linguistic structures get to have their meanings takes the atomistic position that words are the "primary" carrier of meaning i.e words have a preferred ontological status in defining meaning this position was to be the subject of a fierce debate in the indian tradition from the early christian era till the 18th century involving different philosophers from the nyaya mimamsa and buddhist schools
in the pratishakhya text (c 2nd century bce) the gist of the controversy was stated cryptically in the sutra form as "samhita pada-prakr^tih" according to the atomist view the words (pada) would be the primary elements (prakrti) out of which the sentence is constructed while the holistic view considers the sentence as the primary entity originally "given" in its context of utterance and the words are arrived at only through analysis and abstraction
these two positions came to be called a-kshanda-paksha (indivisibility or sentence-holism) a position developed later by bhartrihari (c 500 ad) vs kshanda-paksha (atomism) a position adopted by the mimamsa and nyaya schools (note: kshanda = fragmented; "a-kshanda" = whole)
between the 5th and 3rd centuries bc the atom (anu or aor) is mentioned in the bhagavad gita (chapter 8 verse 9):
kavi puram anusitram aor aysam anusmared ya sarvasya dhtram acintya-rpam ditya-vara tamasa parastt
one meditates on the omniscient primordial the controller smaller than the atom yet the maintainer of everything; whose form is inconceivable resplendent like the sun and totally transcendental to material nature
the ancient shshvata-vda doctrine of eternalism which held that elements are eternal is also suggestive of a possible starting point for atomism (gangopadhyaya 1981)
the atomist position had transcended language into epistemology by the time that nyayavaisesika buddhist and jaina theology were developing mature philosophical positions
will durant wrote in our oriental heritage:
"two systems of indian thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of greece kanada founder of the vaisheshika philosophy held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements the jains more nearly approximated to democritus by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; udayana taught that all heat comes from the sun; and vachaspati like newton interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."
indian atomism in the middle ages was still mostly philosophical and/or religious in intent though it was also scientific because the "infallible vedas" the oldest hindu texts do not mention atoms (though they do mention elements) atomism was not orthodox in many schools of hindu philosophy although accommodationist interpretations or assumptions of lost text justified the use of atomism for non-orthodox schools of hindu thought the buddhist and jaina schools however were more willing to accept the ideas of atomism
=== nyayavaisesika school ===
the nyayavaisesika school developed one of the earliest forms of atomism; scholars date the nyaya and vaisesika texts from the 6th to 1st centuries bc like the buddhist atomists the vaisesika had a pseudo-aristotelian theory of atomism they posited the four elemental atom types but in vaisesika physics atoms had 24 different possible qualities divided between general extensive properties and specific (intensive) properties like the jaina school the nyayavaisesika atomists had elaborate theories of how atoms combine in both jaina and vaisesika atomism atoms first combine in pairs (dyads) and then group into trios of pairs (triads) which are the smallest visible units of matter
=== buddhist school ===
the buddhist atomists had very qualitative aristotelian-style atomic theory according to ancient buddhist atomism which probably began developing before the 4th century bc there are four kinds of atoms corresponding to the standard elements each of these elements has a specific property such as solidity or motion and performs a specific function in mixtures such as providing support or causing growth like the hindu jains the buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their theological presuppositions later indian buddhist philosophers such as dharmakirti and dignga considered atoms to be point-sized durationless and made of energy
=== jaina school ===
the most elaborate and well-preserved indian theory of atomism comes from the philosophy of the jaina school dating back to at least the 6th century bc some of the jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are pancastikayasara kalpasutra tattvarthasutra and pannavana suttam the jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms except for souls paramus or atoms were considered as the basic building blocks of all matter their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms each atom according to jain philosophy has one kind of taste one smell one color and two kinds of touch though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch" atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces and gross in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space certain characteristics of paramu correspond with that sub-atomic particles for example paramu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other paramus it follows a curved path this corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the nucleus ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (snigdha i.e smooth charge) and negative (rksa rough) charges that provide them the binding force although atoms are made of the same basic substance they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six "aggregates" which seem to correspond with the greek concept of "elements": earth water shadow sense objects karmic matter and unfit matter to the jains karma was real but was a naturalistic mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul they also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine react vibrate move and perform other actions all of which were thoroughly deterministic
=== time as explained in srimad-bhagavatam ===
"the material manifestation's ultimate particle which is indivisible and not formed into a body is called the atom (parama-auh) it exists always as an invisible identity even after the dissolution of all forms the material body is but a combination of such atoms but it is misunderstood by the common man
atoms are the ultimate state of the manifest universe when they stay in their own forms without forming different bodies they are called the unlimited oneness there are certainly different bodies in physical forms but the atoms themselves form the complete manifestation
one can estimate time by measuring the movement of the atomic combination of bodies time is the potency of the almighty personality of godhead hari who controls all physical movement although he is not visible in the physical world
the division of gross time is calculated as follows: two atoms make one double atom and three double atoms make one hexatom this hexatom is visible in the sunshine which enters through the holes of a window screen one can clearly see that the hexatom goes up towards the sky
the atom is described as an invisible particle but when six such atoms combine together they are called a trasareu and this is visible in the sunshine pouring through the holes of a window screen."

== islamic atomism ==
atomistic philosophies are found very early in islamic philosophy and was influenced by earlier greek and to some extent indian philosophy like both the greek and indian versions islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy but it was instead more often favoured by orthodox islamic theologians it was such a fertile and flexible idea that as in greece and india it flourished in some leading schools of islamic thought
=== asharite atomism ===
the most successful form of islamic atomism was in the asharite school of islamic theology most notably in the work of the theologian al-ghazali (10581111) in asharite atomism atoms are the only perpetual material things in existence and all else in the world is "accidental" meaning something that lasts for only an instant nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else except perception as it exists for a moment contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes but are the direct result of god's constant intervention without which nothing could happen thus nature is completely dependent on god which meshes with other asharite islamic ideas on causation or the lack thereof (gardet 2001) al-ghazali also used the theory to support his theory of occasionalism in a sense the asharite theory of atomism has far more in common with indian atomism than it does with greek atomism
=== averroism ===
other traditions in islam rejected the atomism of the asharites and expounded on many greek texts especially those of aristotle an active school of philosophers in spain including the noted commentator averroes (ad 11261198) explicitly rejected the thought of al-ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of aristotle averroes commented in detail on most of the works of aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of aristotle in later jewish and christian scholastic thought
== medieval european speculations ==
while aristotelian philosophy eclipsed the importance of the atomists in late roman and medieval europe their work was still preserved and exposited through commentaries on the works of aristotle in the 2nd century galen (ad 129216) presented extensive discussions of the greek atomists especially epicurus in his aristotle commentaries according to historian of atomism joshua gregory there was no serious work done with atomism from the time of galen until gassendi and descartes resurrected it in the 17th century; "the gap between these two 'modern naturalists' and the ancient atomists marked "the exile of the atom" and "it is universally admitted that the middle ages had abandoned atomism and virtually lost it."
however although the ancient atomists' works were unavailable scholastic thinkers still had aristotle's critiques of atomism in the medieval universities there were expressions of atomism for example in the 14th century nicholas of autrecourt considered that matter space and time were all made up of indivisible atoms points and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms the similarities of his ideas with those of al-ghazali suggest that nicholas may have been familiar with ghazali's work perhaps through averroes' refutation of it (marmara 197374)
=== scholastic minima naturalia ===
although the atomism of epicurus had fallen out of favor in the centuries of scholasticism a related aristotelian concept that of minima naturalia (natural minima) received extensive consideration minima naturalia were theorized by aristotle as the smallest parts into which a homogeneous natural substance (e.g. flesh bone or wood) could be divided and still retain its essential character speculation on minima naturalia provided philosophical background for the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers like descartes and for the alchemical works of geber and daniel sennert who in turn influenced the corpuscularian alchemist robert boyle one of the founders of modern chemistry
unlike the atomism of leucippus democritus and epicurus and also unlike the later atomic theory of john dalton the aristotelian natural minimum was not conceptualized as physically indivisible--"atomic" in the contemporary sense instead the concept was rooted in aristotle's hylomorphic worldview which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (greek hyle) and an immaterial substantial form (greek morphe) that imparts its essential nature and structure for instance a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form)
aristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh or bone or wood or some other such organic substance that for aristotle living before the microscope could be considered homogeneous for instance if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum what would be left might be a large amount of the element water and smaller amounts of the other elements but whatever water or other elements were left they would no longer have the "nature" of flesh: in hylomorphic terms they would no longer be matter structured by the form of flesh; instead the remaining water e.g. would be matter structured by the form of water not the form of flesh this is suggestive of modern chemistry in which e.g. a bar of gold can be continually divided until one has a single atom of gold but further division yields only subatomic particles (electrons quarks etc.) which are no longer "gold." however the parallel is not exact: minima naturalia are not a direct anticipation of modern chemical and physical concepts
a chief theme in late roman and scholastic commentary on this concept is reconciling minima naturalia with the general aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility commentators like john philoponus and thomas aquinas reconciled these aspects of aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and "natural" divisibility with few exceptions much of the curriculum in the universities of europe was based on such aristotelianism for most of the middle ages (kargon 1966) scholasticism was standard science in the time of isaac newton but in the 17th century a renewed interest in epicurean atomism and corpuscularianism as a hybrid or an alternative to aristotelian physics had begun to mount outside the classroom
== atomic renaissance ==
the main figures in the rebirth of atomism were ren descartes pierre gassendi and robert boyle as well as other notable figures
one of the first groups of atomists in england was a cadre of amateur scientists known as the northumberland circle led by henry percy (15851632) the 9th earl of northumberland although they published little of account they helped to disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture of england and may have been particularly influential to francis bacon who became an atomist around 1605 though he later rejected some of the claims of atomism though they revived the classical form of atomism this group was among the scientific avant-garde: the northumberland circle contained nearly half of the confirmed copernicans prior to 1610 (the year of galileo's the starry messenger) other influential atomists of late 16th and early 17th centuries include giordano bruno thomas hobbes (who also changed his stance on atomism late in his career) and thomas hariot a number of different atomistic theories were blossoming in france at this time as well (clericuzio 2000)
galileo galilei (15641642) was an advocate of atomism in his 1612 discourse on floating bodies (redondi 1969) in the assayer galileo offered a more complete physical system based on a corpuscular theory of matter in which all phenomenawith the exception of soundare produced by "matter in motion" galileo identified some basic problems with aristotelian physics through his experiments he utilized a theory of atomism as a partial replacement but he was never unequivocally committed to it for example his experiments with falling bodies and inclined planes led him to the concepts of circular inertial motion and accelerating free-fall the current aristotelian theories of impetus and terrestrial motion were inadequate to explain these while atomism did not explain the law of fall either it was a more promising framework in which to develop an explanation because motion was conserved in ancient atomism (unlike aristotelian physics)
ren descartes' (15961650) "mechanical" philosophy of corpuscularism had much in common with atomism and is considered in some senses to be a different version of it descartes thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny vortices of matter like the ancient atomists descartes claimed that sensations such as taste or temperature are caused by the shape and size of tiny pieces of matter the main difference between atomism and descartes' concept was the existence of the void for him there could be no vacuum and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter another key distinction between descartes' view and classical atomism is the mind/body duality of descartes which allowed for an independent realm of existence for thought soul and most importantly god gassendi's concept was closer to classical atomism but with no atheistic overtone
pierre gassendi (15921655) was a catholic priest from france who was also an avid natural philosopher he was particularly intrigued by the greek atomists so he set out to "purify" atomism from its heretical and atheistic philosophical conclusions (dijksterhius 1969) gassendi formulated his atomistic conception of mechanical philosophy partly in response to descartes; he particularly opposed descartes' reductionist view that only purely mechanical explanations of physics are valid as well as the application of geometry to the whole of physics (clericuzio 2000)
=== corpuscularianism ===
corpuscularianism is similar to atomism except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible corpuscles could in principle be divided in this manner for example it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure a step on the way towards transmutative production of gold corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: 'secondary' qualities as distinguished from 'primary' qualities not all corpuscularianism made use of the primary-secondary quality distinction however an influential tradition in medieval and early modern alchemy argued that chemical analysis revealed the existence of robust corpuscles that retained their identity in chemical compounds (to use the modern term) william r newman has dubbed this approach to matter theory "chymical atomism," and has argued for its significance to both the mechanical philosophy and to the chemical atomism that emerged in the early 19th century corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory over the next several hundred years and retained its links with alchemy in the work of scientists such as robert boyle and isaac newton in the 17th century it was used by newton for instance in his development of the corpuscular theory of light the form that came to be accepted by most english scientists after robert boyle (16271692) was an amalgam of the systems of descartes and gassendi in the sceptical chymist (1661) boyle demonstrates problems that arise from chemistry and offers up atomism as a possible explanation the unifying principle that would eventually lead to the acceptance of a hybrid corpuscularatomism was mechanical philosophy which became widely accepted by physical sciences
== atomic theory ==
by the late 18th century the useful practices of engineering and technology began to influence philosophical explanations for the composition of matter those who speculated on the ultimate nature of matter began to verify their "thought experiments" with some repeatable demonstrations when they could
roger boscovich provided the first general mathematical theory of atomism based on the ideas of newton and leibniz but transforming them so as to provide a programme for atomic physics
in 1808 john dalton assimilated the known experimental work of many people to summarize the empirical evidence on the composition of matter he noticed that distilled water everywhere analyzed to the same elements hydrogen and oxygen similarly other purified substances decomposed to the same elements in the same proportions by weight
therefore we may conclude that the ultimate particles of all homogeneous bodies are perfectly alike in weight figure etc in other words every particle of water is like every other particle of water; every particle of hydrogen is like every other particle of hydrogen etc
furthermore he concluded that there was a unique atom for each element using lavoisier's definition of an element as a substance that could not be analyzed into something simpler thus dalton concluded the following
chemical analysis and synthesis go no farther than to the separation of particles one from another and to their reunion no new creation or destruction of matter is within the reach of chemical agency we might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar system or to annihilate one already in existence as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen all the changes we can produce consist in separating particles that are in a state of cohesion or combination and joining those that were previously at a distance
and then he proceeded to give a list of relative weights in the compositions of several common compounds summarizing: [2]
1st that water is a binary compound of hydrogen and oxygen and the relative weights of the two elementary atoms are as 1:7 nearly;
2nd that ammonia is a binary compound of hydrogen and azote nitrogen and the relative weights of the two atoms are as 1:5 nearly
dalton concluded that the fixed proportions of elements by weight suggested that the atoms of one element combined with only a limited number of atoms of the other elements to form the substances that he listed
=== atomic theory controversy ===
dalton's atomic theory remained controversial throughout the 19th century whilst the law of definite proportion was accepted the hypothesis that this was due to atoms was not so widely accepted for example in 1826 when sir humphry davy presented dalton the royal medal from the royal society davy said that the theory only became useful when the atomic conjecture was ignored sir benjamin collins brodie in 1866 published the first part of his calculus of chemical operations as a non-atomic alternative to the atomic theory he described atomic theory as a 'thoroughly materialistic bit of joiners work' alexander williamson used his presidential address to the london chemical society in 1869 to defend the atomic theory against its critics and doubters this in turn led to further meetings at which the positivists again attacked the supposition that there were atoms the matter was finally resolved in dalton's favour in the early 20th century with the rise of atomic physics
