the paleozoic (or palaeozoic) era (/plizok/ or /pelizok/ from the greek palaios () old and zoe () life meaning ancient life") is the earliest of three geologic eras of the phanerozoic eon spanning from 541 to 252.17 million years ago it is the longest of the phanerozoic eras and is subdivided into six geologic periods (from oldest to youngest) the cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous and permian the paleozoic comes after the neoproterozoic era of the proterozoic eon and is followed by the mesozoic era
the paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological climatic and evolutionary change the cambrian period witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in earth's history known as the cambrian explosion in which most modern phyla first appeared fish arthropods amphibians reptiles and synapsids all evolved during the paleozoic life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land and by the late paleozoic it was dominated by various forms of organisms great forests of primitive plants covered the continents many of which formed the coal beds of europe and eastern north america towards the end of the era large sophisticated reptiles were dominant and the first modern plants (conifers) appeared
the paleozoic era ended with the largest mass extinction in earth's history the permiantriassic extinction event the effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the mesozoic to recover recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster
== geologyedit ==
in north america the era began with deep sedimentary basins along the eastern southeastern and western sides of the continent while the interior was dry land as the era proceeded the marginal seas periodically washed over the stable interior leaving sedimentary deposits to mark their incursions during the early part of the era the area of exposed precambrian or shield rocks in central canada were eroding supplying sediment to the basins from the interior beginning in the ordovician period mountain building intermittently proceeded in the eastern part of the appalachian region throughout the rest of the era bringing in new sediments sediments washing from the acadian mountains filled the western part of the appalachian basins to form the famous coal swamps of the carboniferous period in north america carboniferous is not generally used instead the time is divided between mississippian and pennsylvanian periods because of differences in the sedimentary rock deposited during that time the mississippian is characterized by limey sediments deposited in shallow seas typically with abundant crinoidal fossils as in the burlington formation the pennsylvanian typically is characterized by terrestrial sediments such as sands shale and most importantly coal most of our oil and gas are obtained from pennsylvanian sediments where this has been stripped as in the ozark domal region oil is not typically available
paleoclimatic studies and evidence of glaciers indicate that central africa was most likely in the polar regions during the early paleozoic during the early paleozoic the huge continent gondwanaland had either formed or was forming by mid-paleozoic the collision of north america and europe produced the acadian-caledonian uplifts and a subduction plate uplifted eastern australia by the late paleozoic continental collisions formed the supercontinent pangaea and resulted in some of the great mountain chains including the appalachians urals and mountains of tasmania
=== periods of the paleozoicedit ===
there are six periods in the paleozoic era the cambrian the ordovician the silurian the devonian the carboniferous and the permian
==== cambrianedit ====
the cambrian spans from 541 million years to 485 million years ago and is the first period of the paleozoic and of the phanerozoic eon the cambrian sparks a boom in evolution in an event known as the cambrian explosion in which the largest number of creatures evolve in the history of earth during one period creatures like algae evolve but most of the water is populated by armored arthropods like trilobites almost all marine phyla evolved in this period during this time the super-continent rodinia begins to break up most of which becomes the super-continent gondwana
==== ordovicianedit ====
the ordovician spans from 485 million years to 443 million years ago the ordovician is a time in earth's history in which many species still prevalent today evolved such as primitive fish cephalopods and coral the most common forms of life however were trilobites snails and shellfish more importantly the first arthropods went ashore to colonize the empty continent of gondwana by the end of the period gondwana was at the south pole early north america had collided with europe closing the atlantic ocean glaciation of africa resulted in a major drop in sea level killing off all life that staked a claim along coastal gondwana glaciation caused a snowball earth and the ordovician-silurian extinction in which 60% of marine invertebrates and 25% of families went extinct and is considered the first mass extinction and the second deadliest extinction
==== silurianedit ====
the silurian spans from 443 million years to 419 million years ago the silurian saw the healing of the earth that recovered from the snowball earth this period saw the mass evolution of fish as jaw-less fish became more numerous jawed fish evolved and the first freshwater fish evolved though arthropods such as sea scorpions were still apex predators fully terrestrial life evolved which included early arachnids fungi and centipedes also the evolution of vascular plants (cooksonia) allowed plants to gain a foothold on land these early plants are the forerunners of all plant life on land during this time there are four continents gondwana (africa south america australia antarctica siberia) laurentia (north america) baltica (northern europe) and avalonia (western europe) the recent rise in sea levels provided many new species to thrive in water
==== devonianedit ====
the devonian spans from 419 million years to 359 million years ago also known as the age of the fish the devonian features a huge diversification of fish including armored fish like dunkleosteus and lobe-finned fish which eventually evolved into the first tetrapods on land plant groups diversified incredibly in an event known as the devonian explosion where the first trees evolved as well as seeds this event also diversified arthropod life the first amphibians also evolved and the fish were now at the top of the food chain near the end of the devonian 70% of all species went extinct in an event known as the late devonian extinction and is the second mass extinction event the world has seen
==== carboniferousedit ====
the carboniferous spans from 359 million to 299 million years ago during this time average global temperatures were exceedingly high the early carboniferous averaged at about 20 degrees celsius (but cooled down to 10 degrees during the middle carboniferous) tropical swamps dominated the earth and the large amounts of trees created much of the carbon for the coal that is used today (hence the name carbon-iferous") perhaps the most important evolutionary development of the time was the evolution of amniotic eggs which allowed amphibians to head farther inland and remained the dominant vertebrae throughout the duration of this period also the first reptiles and synapsids evolved in the swamps throughout the carboniferous there was a cooling pattern which eventually led to the glaciation of gondwana as much of it was situated around the south pole in an event known as the permo-carboniferous glaciation or the carboniferous rainforest collapse
==== permianedit ====
the permian spans from 299 million to 252 million years ago and was the last period of the paleozoic at the beginning all continents joined together to form the super-continent pangaea which was encircled by one ocean called panthalassa the earth was very dry during this time with harsh seasons as the climate of the interior of pangaea wasn't regulated by large bodies of water reptiles and synapsids flourished in the new dry climate creatures such as dimetrodon and edaphosaurus ruled the new continent the first conifers evolve and dominate the terrestrial landscape nearing the end of the permian however pangaea got drier and drier the interior was nothing but dry deserts and new species such as scutosaurus and gorgonopsids filled the empty desert eventually they disappeared along with 95% of all life on earth in a cataclysm known as the great dying the third and most severe mass extinction in world history
== tectonic activityedit ==
geologically the paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called pannotia throughout the early paleozoic the earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of continents towards the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called pangaea which included most of the earth's land area
== climateedit ==
the ordovician and silurian periods were warm greenhouse periods with the highest sea levels of the paleozoic (200 m above today's) the warm climate was interrupted only by a 30 million years cool period the early palaeozoic icehouse culminating in the hirnantian glaciation
the early cambrian climate was probably moderate at first becoming warmer over the course of the cambrian as the second-greatest sustained sea level rise in the phanerozoic got underway however as if to offset this trend gondwana moved south with considerable speed so that in ordovician time most of west gondwana (africa and south america) lay directly over the south pole the early paleozoic climate was also strongly zonal with the result that the climate in an abstract sense became warmer but the living space of most organisms of the timethe continental shelf marine environmentbecame steadily colder however baltica (northern europe and russia) and laurentia (eastern north america and greenland) remained in the tropical zone while china and australia lay in waters which were at least temperate the early paleozoic ended rather abruptly with the short but apparently severe late ordovician ice age this cold spell caused the second-greatest mass extinction of phanerozoic time over time the warmer weather moved into the paleozoic era
the middle paleozoic was a time of considerable stability sea levels had dropped coincident with the ice age but slowly recovered over the course of the silurian and devonian the slow merger of baltica and laurentia and the northward movement of bits and pieces of gondwana created numerous new regions of relatively warm shallow sea floor as plants took hold on the continental margins oxygen levels increased and carbon dioxide dropped although much less dramatically the northsouth temperature gradient also seems to have moderated or metazoan life simply became hardier or both at any event the far southern continental margins of antarctica and west gondwana became increasingly less barren the devonian ended with a series of turnover pulses which killed off much of middle paleozoic vertebrate life without noticeably reducing species diversity overall
the late paleozoic was a time which has left us a good many unanswered questions the mississippian began with a spike in atmospheric oxygen while carbon dioxide plummeted to unheard-of lows this destabilized the climate and led to one and perhaps two ice ages during the carboniferous these were far more severe than the brief late ordovician ice but this time the effects on world biota were inconsequential by the cisuralian both oxygen and carbon dioxide had recovered to more normal levels on the other hand the assembly of pangaea created huge arid inland areas subject to temperature extremes the lopingian is associated with falling sea levels increased carbon dioxide and general climatic deterioration culminating in the devastation of the permian extinction
== floraedit ==
while macroscopic plant life appeared early in the paleozoic and possibly late in the neoproterozoic it mostly remained aquatic until sometime in the silurian and devonian when it began to transition onto dry land terrestrial flora reached its climax in the carboniferous when towering lycopsid rainforests dominated the tropical belt of euramerica climate change caused the carboniferous rainforest collapse which fragmented this habitat diminishing the diversity of plant life in the late carboniferous and permian
== faunaedit ==
a noteworthy feature of paleozoic life is the sudden appearance of nearly all of the invertebrate animal phyla in great abundance at the beginning of the cambrian the first vertebrates appeared in the form of primitive fish which greatly diversified in the silurian and devonian the first animals to venture onto dry land were the arthropods some fish had lungs and powerful bony fins that also could crawl onto land the bones in their fins eventually evolved into legs and they became the first tetrapods amphibians were the dominant tetrapods until the mid-carboniferous when climate change greatly reduced their diversity later reptiles prospered and continued to increase in number and variety by the late permian
