tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles) each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court the object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return the player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point while the opposite player will
tennis is an olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages the sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket including wheelchair users the modern game of tennis originated in birmingham england in the late 19th century as lawn tennis it had close connections both to various field ("lawn") games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis during most of the 19th-century in fact the term tennis referred to real tennis not lawn tennis for example in disraeli's novel sybil (1845) lord eugene de vere announces that he will go down to hampton court and play tennis.
the rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s a recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system which allows a player to contest the line call of a point
tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport the four grand slam tournaments (also referred to as the majors") are especially popular the australian open played on hard courts the french open played on red clay courts wimbledon played on grass courts and the us open played also on hard courts
== history ==
=== predecessors ===
historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern france where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand louis x of france was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm") which evolved into real tennis and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor enclosed courts made in paris around the end of the 13th century in due course this design spread across royal palaces all over europe in june 1316 at vincennes val-de-marne and following a particularly exhausting game louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy although there was also suspicion of poisoning because of the contemporary accounts of his death louis x is history's first tennis player known by name another of the early enthusiasts of the game was king charles v of france who had a court set up at the louvre palace
it wasn't until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called tennis from the old french term tenez which can be translated as hold! receive! or take! an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent it was popular in england and france although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall henry viii of england was a big fan of this game which is now known as real tennis during the 18th century and early 19th century as real tennis declined new racket sports emerged in england
further the patenting of the first lawn mower in 1830 in britain is strongly believed to have been the catalyst world-wide for the preparation of modern-style grass courts sporting ovals playing fields pitches greens etc this in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports including lawn tennis most football codes lawn bowls and others
=== origins of the modern game ===
between 1859 and 1865 harry gem and his friend augurio perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the basque ball game pelota which they played on perera's croquet lawn in birmingham england united kingdom in 1872 along with two local doctors they founded the world's first tennis club in leamington spa
in december 1873 british army officer major walter clopton wingfield designed and patented a similar game  which he called sphairistik (greek  meaning ball-playing") and was soon known simply as sticky for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of nantclwyd hall in llanelidan wales according to r d c evans turfgrass agronomist sports historians all agree that [wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis. according to honor godfrey museum curator at wimbledon wingfield popularized this game enormously he produced a boxed set which included a net poles rackets balls for playing the game -- and most importantly you had his rules he was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world he had very good connections with the clergy the law profession and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so in 1874. the world's oldest tennis tournament the wimbledon championships were first played in london in 1877 the first championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules
in the u.s in 1874 mary ewing outerbridge a young socialite returned from bermuda with a sphairistik set she became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching british army officers play she laid out a tennis court at the staten island cricket club at camp washington tompkinsville staten island new york the first american national championship was played there in september 1880 an englishman named o.e woodhouse won the singles title and a silver cup worth $100 by defeating canadian i f hellmuth there was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair there were different rules at each club the ball in boston was larger than the one normally used in new york on 21 may 1881 the united states national lawn tennis association (now the united states tennis association) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions the u.s national men's singles championship now the us open was first held in 1881 at the newport casino newport rhode island the u.s national women's singles championships were first held in 1887 in philadelphia
tennis also became popular in france where the french championships dates to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of french clubs thus wimbledon the us open the french open and the australian open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis together these four events are called the majors or slams (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball)
the comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the international lawn tennis federation now known as the international tennis federation (itf) have remained largely stable in the ensuing eighty years the one major change being the addition of the tiebreak system designed by jimmy van alen that same year tennis withdrew from the olympics after the 1924 games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984 this reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then itf president philippe chatrier itf general secretary david gray and itf vice president pablo llorens and support from ioc president juan antonio samaranch the success of the event was overwhelming and the ioc decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at seoul in 1988
the davis cup an annual competition between men's national teams dates to 1900 the analogous competition for women's national teams the fed cup was founded as the federation cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the itf
in 1926 promoter c c pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of american and french tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences the most notable of these early professionals were the american vinnie richards and the frenchwoman suzanne lenglen once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments
in 1968 commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction inaugurating the open era in which all players could compete in all tournaments and top players were able to make their living from tennis with the beginning of the open era the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit and revenues from the sale of television rights tennis's popularity has spread worldwide and the sport has shed its middle-class english-speaking image (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists)
in 1954 van alen founded the international tennis hall of fame a non-profit museum in newport rhode island the building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world each year a grass court tournament and an induction ceremony honoring new hall of fame members are hosted on its grounds
== equipment ==
part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play beginners need only a racket and balls
=== rackets ===
the components of a tennis racket include a handle known as the grip connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings for the first 100 years of the modern game rackets were made of wood and of standard size and strings were of animal gut laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite ceramics and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced these stronger materials enabled the production of over-sized rackets that yielded yet more power meanwhile technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability
under modern rules of tennis the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines
the hitting area composed of the strings must be flat and generally uniform
the frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in width
the entire racket must be of a fixed shape size weight and weight distribution there may not be any energy source built into the rackets
the rackets must not provide any kind of communication instruction or advice to the player during the match
the rules regarding rackets have changed over time as material and engineering advances have been made for example the maximum length of the frame had been 32 inches until 1997 when it was shortened to 29 inches
many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets wilson head and babolat are some of the more commonly used brands however many more companies exist the same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public
=== balls ===
tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating traditionally white the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size weight deformation and bounce to be approved for regulation play the international tennis federation (itf) defines the official diameter as 65.41-68.58 mm (2.575-2.700 inches) balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 grams (1.975-2.095 ounces) tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the united states and europe although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the far east the relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region
=== miscellaneous ===
advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players grip players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry as well finally although the game can be played in a variety of shoes specialized tennis shoes have wide flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear
== manner of play ==
for individual terms see glossary of tennis
=== court ===
tennis is played on a rectangular flat surface the court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long and 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles matches additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls a net is stretched across the full width of the court parallel with the baselines dividing it into two equal ends it is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can be no more than 0.8 cm (1/3 inch) the net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.067 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.914 m) high in the center the net posts are 3 feet (0.914 m) outside the doubles court on each side or for a singles net 3 feet (0.914 m) outside the singles court on each side
the modern tennis court owes its design to major walter clopton wingfield who in 1873 patented a court much the same as the current one for his stick tennis (sphairistike) this template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today with markings similar to wingfield's version but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle
tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces grass clay and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common occasionally carpet is used for indoor play with hardwood flooring having been historically used artificial turf courts can also be found
==== lines ====
the lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court) the short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark the outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines these are the boundaries used when doubles is being played the lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play the area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley which is considered playable in doubles play the line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side despite its name this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve
the line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line the boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes depending on a player's position he or she will have to hit the ball into one of these when serving a ball is out only if none of it has hit the line or the area inside the lines upon its first bounce all the lines are required to be between 1 and 2 inches (51 mm) in width the baseline can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide
=== play of a single point ===
the players (or teams) start on opposite sides of the net one player is designated the server and the opposing player is the receiver the choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts service alternates game by game between the two players (or teams) for each point the server starts behind the baseline between the center mark and the sideline the receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net when the receiver is ready the server will serve although the receiver must play to the pace of the server
in a legal service the ball travels over the net (without touching it) and into the diagonally opposite service box if the ball hits the net but lands in the service box this is a let or net service which is void and the server retakes that serve the player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults a fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box or does not clear the net there is also a foot fault which occurs when a player's foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit if the second service is also a fault the server double faults and the receiver wins the point however if the serve is in it is considered a legal service
a legal service starts a rally in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net a legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net provided that it still falls in the server's court a player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row the ball must travel past the net into the other players court a ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court the first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point the server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point
=== scoring ===
==== game set match ====
game
a game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving a game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent the running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis scores from zero to three points are described as love fifteen thirty and forty respectively if at least three points have been scored by each player making the player's scores equal at forty apiece the score is not called out as forty-forty but rather as deuce if at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent the score of the game is advantage for the player in the lead during informal games advantage can also be called ad in or van in when the serving player is ahead and ad out or van out when the receiving player is ahead
the score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first in tournament play the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g. fifteen-love") after each point at the end of a game the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score
set
a set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria typically a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent if one player has won six games and the opponent five an additional game is played if the leading player wins that game the player wins the set 75 if the trailing player wins the game a tie-break is played a tie-break played under a separate set of rules allows one player to win one more game and thus the set to give a final set score of 76 a love set means that the loser of the set won zero games colloquially termed a jam donut in the usa in tournament play the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score the final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first e.g 62 46 60 75
match
a match consists of a sequence of sets the outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system recreational players may agree to play any number of sets depending upon time availability or stamina on the professional circuit men play best-of-five-set matches at all four grand slam tournaments davis cup and the final of the olympic games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments the first player to win two sets in a best-of-three or three sets in a best-of-five wins the match only in the final sets of matches at the australian open the french open wimbledon the olympic games davis cup and fed cup are tie-breaks not played in these cases sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead leading to some remarkably long matches
in tournament play the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase game set match followed by the winning person's or team's name
==== special point terms ====
game point
a game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game the terminology is extended to sets (set point) matches (match point) and even championships (championship point) for example if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love the player has a triple game point (triple set point etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game game points set points and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play
break point
a break point occurs if the receiver not the server has a chance to win the game with the next point break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving a receiver who has one (score of 3040) two (score of 1540) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point double break point or triple break point respectively if the receiver does in fact win their break point the game is awarded to the receiver and the receiver is said to have converted their break point if the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert winning break points and thus the game is also referred to as breaking serve as the receiver has disrupted or broken the natural advantage of the server if in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back at least one break of serve is required to win a set
=== rule variations ===
no ad
from no advantage scoring method created by jimmy van alen the first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points when the game score reaches three points each the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point utilized by world team tennis professional competition and itf junior doubles
pro set
instead of playing multiple sets players may play one pro set a pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games instead of first to 6 games a 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 88 (or 1010) these are often played with no-ad scoring
match tie-break
this is sometimes played instead of a third set a match tie-break is played like a regular tie-break but the winner must win ten points instead of seven match tie-breaks are used in the hopman cup and the 2012 olympic games for mixed doubles on the atp and wta tours for doubles and as a player's choice in usta league play
another however informal tennis format is called canadian doubles this involves three players with one person playing a doubles team the single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team conversely the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot the scoring is the same as a regular game this format is not sanctioned by any official body
australian doubles another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis is played with similar rules to the canadian doubles style only in this version players rotate court position after each game as such each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match with the singles player always serving scoring styles vary but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve
wheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility an extra bounce is permitted this rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches it is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as one-up one-down") or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player in such cases the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only
== officials ==
in most professional play and some amateur competition there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to as the umpire) who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court the umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations the umpire may be assisted by line judges who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults there also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service the umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made
in some tournaments line judges who would be calling the serve were assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate the serve was out this system was called cyclops cyclops has since largely been replaced by the hawk-eye system in professional tournaments using this system players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review the us open miami masters us open series and world team tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the australian open and wimbledon introduced the system in 2007 in clay-court matches such as at the french open a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface
the referee who is usually located off the court is the final authority about tennis rules when called to the court by a player or team captain the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact if however the referee is on the court during play the referee may overrule the umpire's decision (this would only happen in davis cup or fed cup matches not at the world group level when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair)
ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls pass them to the players and hand players their towels they have no adjudicative role in rare events (e.g. if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance) the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened the umpire may consider their statements when making a decision in some leagues especially junior leagues players make their own calls trusting each other to be honest this is the case for many school and university level matches the referee or referee's assistant however can be called on court at a player's request and the referee or assistant may change a player's call in unofficiated matches a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out
== junior tennis ==
in tennis a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian these players however are still eligible to play in junior tournaments
the international tennis federation (itf) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an association of tennis professionals (atp) or women's tennis association (wta) ranking most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through itf satellite future and challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit the latter three circuits also have adults competing in them some juniors however such as australian lleyton hewitt and frenchman gal monfils have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the atp tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments
in 2004 the itf implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the grand slam tournaments which are the most prestigious junior events juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the future satellite or challenger tours tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points culminating with grade a
leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the junior fed cup and davis cup competitions to succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age to facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces accommodating all different standards of play talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions
== match play ==
=== continuity ===
a tennis match is intended to be continuous because stamina is a relevant factor arbitrary delays are not permitted in most cases service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point this is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game) and a 2-minute break is permitted between sets other than this breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players control such as rain damaged footwear damaged racket or the need to retrieve an errant ball should a player be determined to be stalling repeatedly the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of point game and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit
in the event of a rain delay darkness or other external conditions halting play the match is resumed at a later time with the same score as at the time of the delay and the players at the same end of the court when rain halted play or at the same position (north or south) if play is resumed on a different court
=== ball changes ===
balls wear out quickly in serious play and therefore in atp and wta tournaments they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up as a courtesy to the receiver the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls however in itf tournaments like fed cup the balls are changed in a 911 style continuity of the balls condition is considered part of the game so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain) then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes
=== on-court coaching ===
a recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match this has been introduced in women's tennis for wta tour events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set
== shots ==
a competent tennis player has eight basic shots in his or her repertoire the serve forehand backhand volley half-volley overhead smash drop shot and lob
=== grip ===
a grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match the grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace spin and placement of the shot players use various grips during play including the continental (the handshake grip") eastern (can be either semi-eastern or full eastern usually used for backhands.) and western (semi-western or full western usually for forehand grips) grips most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting for example slice shots and serves call for a continental grip
=== serve ===
a serve (or more formally a service") in tennis is a shot to start a point the serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net the serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity if the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a let and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in there can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared if the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve then they get one more try to get the serve in the box
experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement the server may employ different types of serve including flat serve topspin serve slice serve and kick (american twist) serve a reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness if the ball is spinning counterclockwise it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise
some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point however advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve a winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an ace
=== forehand ===
for a right-handed player the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body continues across the body as contact is made with the ball and ends on the left side of the body there are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years the most important ones are the continental the eastern the semi-western and the western for a number of years the small frail 1920s player bill johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip few top players used the western grip after the 1920s but in the latter part of the 20th century as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players no matter which grip is used most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands in the 1940s and 50s the ecuadorian/american player pancho segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger more powerful players players such as monica seles or france's fabrice santoro and marion bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands
=== backhand ===
for right-handed players the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body continues across their body as contact is made with the ball and ends on the right side of their body it can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand for most of the 20th century the backhand was performed with one hand using either an eastern or a continental grip the first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s australians vivian mcgrath and john bromwich but they were lonely exceptions the two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as bjrn borg chris evert jimmy connors and later mats wilander and marat safin used it to great effect and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players including rafael nadal and serena williams
two hands give the player more control while one hand can generate a slice shot applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce reach is also limited with the two-handed shot the player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time don budge had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball ken rosewall another player noted for his one-handed backhand used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s a small number of players notably monica seles use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides
=== other shots ===
a volley is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces generally performed near the net and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court the half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced also generally in the vicinity of the net and played with the racket close to the ground the swinging volley is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net it is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent as it returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley
from a poor defensive position on the baseline the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head if the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court however an opponent near the net may then hit an overhead smash a hard serve-like shot to try to end the point
a difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player when the contact point is higher than the reach of a two-handed backhand most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways) fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash rarely a player will go for a high topspin backhand while themselves in the air a successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play
if an opponent is deep in his court a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot causing the ball to skid upon landing and bounce sideways with less forward momentum toward their opponent or even backwards towards the net thus making it even more difficult to return
