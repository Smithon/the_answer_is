elemental analysis is a process where a sample of some material (e.g. soil waste or drinking water bodily fluids minerals chemical compounds) is analyzed for its elemental and sometimes isotopic composition elemental analysis can be qualitative (determining what elements are present) and it can be quantitative (determining how much of each are present) elemental analysis falls within the ambit of analytical chemistry the set of instruments involved in deciphering the chemical nature of our world
for organic chemists elemental analysis or "ea" almost always refers to chnx analysisthe determination of the mass fractions of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and heteroatoms (x) (halogens sulfur) of a sample this information is important to help determine the structure of an unknown compound as well as to help ascertain the structure and purity of a synthesized compound
== methodsedit ==
the most common form of elemental analysis chn analysis is accomplished by combustion analysis in this technique a sample is burned in an excess of oxygen and various traps collecting the combustion products: carbon dioxide water and nitric oxide the masses of these combustion products can be used to calculate the composition of the unknown sample
=== quantitativeedit ===
quantitative analysis is the determination of the mass of each element or compound present other quantitative methods include:
gravimetry where the sample is dissolved and then the element of interest is precipitated and its mass measured or the element of interest is volatilized and the mass loss is measured
optical atomic spectroscopy such as flame atomic absorption graphite furnace atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy which probe the outer electronic structure of atoms
neutron activation analysis which involves the activation of a sample matrix through the process of neutron capture the resulting radioactive target nuclei of the sample begin to decay emitting gamma rays of specific energies that identify the radioisotopes present in the sample the concentration of each analyte can be determined by comparison to an irradiated standard with known concentrations of each analyte
=== qualitativeedit ===
to qualitatively determine which elements exist in a sample the methods are:
mass spectrometric atomic spectroscopy such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry which probes the mass of atoms
other spectroscopy which probes the inner electronic structure of atoms such as x-ray fluorescence particle-induced x-ray emission x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and auger electron spectroscopy
chemical methods
sodium fusion test
schniger oxidation
=== analysis of resultsedit ===
the analysis of results is performed by determining the ratio of elements from within the sample and working out a chemical formula that fits with those results this process is useful as it helps determine if a sample sent is a desired compound and confirms the purity of a compound the accepted deviation of elemental analysis results from the calculated is 0.4%
