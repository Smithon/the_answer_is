an astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists
starting in the 1950s up to 2002 astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut
== definitionedit ==
the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary the fdration aronautique internationale (fai) sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 mi) in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) are awarded astronaut wings
as of 8 june 2013 a total of 532 people from 36 countries have reached 100 km (62 mi) or more in altitude of which 529 reached low earth orbit or beyond of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit to either lunar or trans-lunar orbit or to the surface of the moon three of the 24 did so twice jim lovell john young and eugene cernan the three astronauts who have not reached low earth orbit are spaceplane pilots joe walker mike melvill and brian binnie
as of 20 june 2011 under the u.s definition 538 people qualify as having reached space above 50 miles (80 km) altitude of eight x-15 pilots who exceeded 50 miles (80 km) in altitude only one exceeded 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) space travelers have spent over 41,790 man-days (114.5 man-years) in space including over 100 astronaut-days of spacewalks as of 2008 the man with the longest cumulative time in space is sergei k krikalev who has spent 803 days 9 hours and 39 minutes or 2.2 years in space peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days
== terminologyedit ==
in 1959 when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos (near space) while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut
=== englishedit ===
in english-speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words stron () meaning star and nautes () meaning sailor the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the death's head meteor in 1930 the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy greg's 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de l'infini (1925) of j.-h rosny an the word astronautique (astronautic) was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to balloonists an early use in a non-fiction publication is eric frank russell's poem the astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society
the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year
nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps
=== russianedit ===
by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency (or its soviet predecessor) is called a cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt (russian russian pronunciation [ksmnaft]) one who works in space outside the earth's atmosphere a space traveler which derives from the greek words kosmos () meaning universe and nautes () meaning sailor other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta
the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut
=== chineseedit ===
official english-language texts issued by the government of china use astronaut while texts in russian use (cosmonaut) in official chinese-language texts y hng yun ( space navigating personnel") is used for astronauts and cosmonauts and hng tin yun ( space navigating personnel") is used for chinese astronauts the phrase ti kng rn ( spaceman") is often used in hong kong and taiwan
the term taikonaut is used by some english-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong (space) and the greek naut (sailor) the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese people's daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih () from malaysia used it in newsgroups
=== other termsedit ===
with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies
while no nation other than the russian federation (and previously the former soviet union) the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut (french spelling spationaute) is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organization hope to launch a spacecraft in 2018 that would carry vyomanauts coined from the sanskrit word for space

== trainingedit ==
the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in 1959 early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter (of the mercury seven) had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots
once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasa's neutral buoyancy laboratory astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified kc-135s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c-9) which perform parabolic flights astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in t-38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are done out of edwards air force base

== health risks of space traveledit ==
astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute (nsbri) to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts (including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare
on december 31 2012 a nasa-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimer's disease
in october 2015 the nasa office of inspector general issued a health hazards report related to space exploration including a human mission to mars
== food and drinkedit ==
an astronaut on the international space station requires about 0.83 kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day (the packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds) longer-duration missions require more food
shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes five months before flight menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (bee) formula on earth the average american uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day
== insigniaedit ==
in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot-cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation this follows the practice established in the ussr where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title hero of the soviet union
at nasa those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin once they have flown in space they receive a gold pin u.s astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge known as the astronaut badge after participation on a spaceflight the united states air force also presents an astronaut badge to its pilots who exceed 50 miles (80 km) in altitude
== deathsedit ==
eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights by nationality thirteen were american (including one of indian origin) four were russian (soviet union) and one was israeli
eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight eight americans and three russians six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft one drowned during water recovery training and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments
the space mirror memorial which stands on the grounds of the john f kennedy space center visitor complex commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the united states in addition to twenty nasa career astronauts the memorial includes the names of a u.s air force x-15 test pilot a u.s air force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program and a civilian spaceflight participant
