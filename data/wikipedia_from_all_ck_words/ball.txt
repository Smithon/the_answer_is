== etymology ==
the first known use of the word ball in english in the sense of a globular body that is played with was in 1205 in laamon's brut or chronicle of britain in the phrase summe heo driuen balles wide eond a feldes. the word came from the middle english bal (inflected as ball-e -es in turn from old norse bllr (pronounced [blr] compare old swedish baller and swedish boll) from proto-germanic ballu-z (whence probably middle high german bal ball-es middle dutch bal) a cognate with old high german ballo pallo middle high german balle from proto-germanic *ballon (weak masculine) and old high german ball pall middle high german balle proto-germanic *balln (weak feminine) no old english representative of any of these is known (the answering forms in old english would have been beallu -a -ecompare bealluc ballock.) if ball- was native in germanic it may have been a cognate with the latin foll-is in sense of a thing blown up or inflated. in the later middle english spelling balle the word coincided graphically with the french balle ball and bale which has hence been erroneously assumed to be its source french balle (but not boule) is assumed to be of germanic origin itself however in ancient greek the word (palla) for ball is attested besides the word  sphere
