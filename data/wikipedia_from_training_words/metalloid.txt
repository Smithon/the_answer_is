a metalloid is a chemical element with properties in between or that are a mixture of those of metals and nonmetals there is no standard definition of a metalloid nor is there complete agreement as to which elements are appropriately classified as such despite this lack of specificity the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry
the six commonly recognised metalloids are boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium elements less commonly recognised as metalloids include carbon aluminium selenium polonium and astatine on a standard periodic table all of these elements may be found in a diagonal region of the p-block extending from boron at one end to astatine at the other some periodic tables include a dividing line between metals and nonmetals and the metalloids may be found close to this line
typical metalloids have a metallic appearance but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity chemically they mostly behave as nonmetals they can form alloys with metals most of their other physical and chemical properties are intermediate in nature metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses they and their compounds are used in alloys biological agents catalysts flame retardants glasses optical storage and optoelectronics pyrotechnics semiconductors and electronics
the electrical properties of silicon and germanium enabled the establishment of the semiconductor industry in the 1950s and the development of solid-state electronics from the early 1960s
the term metalloid originally referred to nonmetals its more recent meaning as a category of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties became widespread in 19401960 metalloids sometimes are called semimetals a practice that has been discouraged as the term semimetal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry in physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance
== definitions ==
=== judgement-based ===
a metalloid is an element with properties in between or that are a mixture of those of metals and nonmetals and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal this is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced only the elements at or near the margins lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties are classified as metalloids
boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium are recognised commonly as metalloids depending on the author one or more from selenium polonium or astatine sometimes are added to the list boron sometimes is excluded by itself or with silicon sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid the inclusion of antimony polonium and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned
other elements occasionally are classified as metalloids these elements include hydrogen beryllium nitrogen phosphorus sulfur zinc gallium tin iodine lead bismuth and radon the term metalloid also has been used for elements that exhibit metallic lustre and electrical conductivity and that are amphoteric such as arsenic antimony vanadium chromium molybdenum tungsten tin lead and aluminium the p-block metals and nonmetals (such as carbon or nitrogen) that can form alloys with metals or modify their properties also have occasionally been considered as metalloids
=== criteria-based ===
no widely accepted definition of a metalloid exists nor any division of the periodic table into metals metalloids and nonmetals hawkes questioned the feasibility of establishing a specific definition noting that anomalies can be found in several attempted constructs classifying an element as a metalloid has been described by sharp as arbitrary
the number and identities of metalloids depend on what classification criteria are used emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium) james et al listed twelve (emsley's plus boron carbon silicon selenium bismuth polonium ununpentium and livermorium) on average seven elements are included in such lists individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins
a single quantitative criterion such as electronegativity is commonly used metalloids having electronegativity values from 1.8 or 1.9 to 2.2 further examples include packing efficiency (the fraction of volume in a crystal structure occupied by atoms) and the goldhammer-herzfeld criterion ratio the commonly recognised metalloids have packing efficiencies of between 34% and 41% the goldhammer-herzfeld ratio roughly equal to the cube of the atomic radius divided by the molar volume is a simple measure of how metallic an element is the recognised metalloids having ratios from around 0.85 to 1.1 and averaging 1.0 other authors have relied on for example atomic conductance or bulk coordination number
jones writing on the role of classification in science observed that [classes] are usually defined by more than two attributes masterton and slowinski used three criteria to describe the six elements commonly recognised as metalloids metalloids have ionization energies around 200 kcal/mol (837 kj/mol) and electronegativity values close to 2.0 they also said that metalloids are typically semiconductors though antimony and arsenic (semimetals from a physics perspective) have electrical conductivities approaching those of metals selenium and polonium are suspected as not in this scheme while astatine's status is uncertain
== periodic table territory ==
=== location ===
metalloids lie on either side of the dividing line between metals and nonmetals this can be found in varying configurations on some periodic tables elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour when presented as a regular stairstep elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (li be al ge sb po) lie just below the line
the diagonal positioning of the metalloids represents an exception to the observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups a related effect can be seen in other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours specifically lithium-magnesium beryllium-aluminium and boron-silicon rayner-canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus nitrogen-sulfur and into three d-block series
this exception arises due to competing horizontal and vertical trends in the nuclear charge going along a period the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons the additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons with some irregularities atoms therefore become smaller ionization energy increases and there is a gradual change in character across a period from strongly metallic to weakly metallic to weakly nonmetallic to strongly nonmetallic elements going down a main group the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus atoms generally become larger ionization energy falls and metallic character increases the net effect is that the location of the metalnonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table as noted
=== alternative treatments ===
depictions of metalloids vary according to the author some do not classify elements bordering the metalnonmetal dividing line as metalloids noting that a binary classification can facilitate the establishment of rules for determining bond types between metals and nonmetals metalloids are variously grouped with metals regarded as nonmetals or treated as a sub-category of nonmetals other authors have suggested that classifying some elements as metalloids emphasizes that properties change gradually rather than abruptly as one moves across or down the periodic table some periodic tables distinguish elements that are metalloids and display no formal dividing line between metals and nonmetals metalloids are shown as occurring in a diagonal band or diffuse region
== properties ==
metalloids usually look like metals but behave largely like nonmetals physically they are shiny brittle solids with intermediate to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band structure of a semimetal or semiconductor chemically they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides they can form alloys with metals most of their other physical and chemical properties are intermediate in nature
=== compared to metals and nonmetals ===
characteristic properties of metals metalloids and nonmetals are summarized in the table physical properties are listed in order of ease of determination chemical properties run from general to specific and then to descriptive
the above table reflects the hybrid nature of metalloids the properties of form appearance and behaviour when mixed with metals are more like metals elasticity and general chemical behaviour are more like nonmetals electrical conductivity band structure ionization energy electronegativity and oxides are intermediate between the two
== common applications ==
the focus of this section is on the recognised metalloids elements less often recognised as metalloids are ordinarily classified as either metals or nonmetals some of these are included here for comparative purposes
metalloids are too brittle to have any structural uses in their pure forms they and their compounds are used as (or in) alloying components biological agents (toxicological nutritional and medicinal) catalysts flame retardants glasses (oxide and metallic) optical storage media and optoelectronics pyrotechnics semiconductors and electronics
=== alloys ===
writing early in the history of intermetallic compounds the british metallurgist cecil desch observed that certain non-metallic elements are capable of forming compounds of distinctly metallic character with metals and these elements may therefore enter into the composition of alloys he associated silicon arsenic and tellurium in particular with the alloy-forming elements phillips and williams suggested that compounds of silicon germanium arsenic and antimony with b metals are probably best classed as alloys
among the lighter metalloids alloys with transition metals are well-represented boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals of the composition mnb if n > 2 ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries respectively germanium forms many alloys most importantly with the coinage metals
the heavier metalloids continue the theme arsenic can form alloys with metals including platinum and copper it is also added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium antimony is well known as an alloy-former including with the coinage metals its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony) tellurium readily alloys with iron as ferrotellurium (5058% tellurium) and with copper in the form of copper tellurium (4050% tellurium) ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids seleniumin the form of ferroselenium (5058% selenium)is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels
=== biological agents ===
all six of the elements commonly recognised as metalloids have toxic dietary or medicinal properties arsenic and antimony compounds are especially toxic boron silicon and possibly arsenic are essential trace elements boron silicon arsenic and antimony have medical applications and germanium and tellurium are thought to have potential
boron is used in insecticides and herbicides it is an essential trace element as boric acid it has antiseptic antifungal and antiviral properties
silicon is present in silatrane a highly toxic rodenticide long-term inhalation of silica dust causes silicosis a fatal disease of the lungs silicon is an essential trace element silicone gel can be applied to badly burned patients to reduce scarring
salts of germanium are potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested on a prolonged basis there is interest in the pharmacological actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine as yet
arsenic is notoriously poisonous and may also be an essential element in ultratrace amounts it has been used as a pharmaceutical agent since antiquity including for the treatment of syphilis before the development of antibiotics arsenic is also a component of melarsoprol a medicinal drug used in the treatment of human african trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness in 2003 arsenic trioxide (under the trade name trisenox) was re-introduced for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia a cancer of the blood and bone marrow arsenic in drinking water which causes lung and bladder cancer has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality rates
metallic antimony is relatively non-toxic but most antimony compounds are poisonous two antimony compounds sodium stibogluconate and stibophen are used as antiparasitical drugs
elemental tellurium is not considered particularly toxic two grams of sodium tellurate if administered can be lethal people exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour tellurium dioxide has been used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics in the future such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance
of the elements less often recognised as metalloids beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity lead arsenate has been extensively used as an insecticide sulfur is one of the oldest of the fungicides and pesticides phosphorus sulfur zinc selenium and iodine are essential nutrients and aluminium tin and lead may be sulfur gallium selenium iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer gallium citrate a radiopharmaceutical facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials
=== catalysts ===
boron trifluoride and trichloride are used as catalysts in organic synthesis and electronics the tribromide is used in the manufacture of diborane non-toxic boron ligands can replace toxic phosphorus ligands in transition metal catalysts silica sulfuric acid (sio2oso3h) is used in organic reactions germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of pet plastic for containers cheaper antimony compounds such as the trioxide or triacetate are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas to boost the removal of carbon dioxide as have selenous acid and tellurous acid selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms tellurium and its dioxide and tetrachloride are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500 c graphite oxide can be used as a catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals
=== flame retardants ===
compounds of boron silicon arsenic and antimony have been used as flame retardants boron in the form of borax has been used as a textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century silicon compounds such as silicones silanes silsesquioxane silica and silicates some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials arsenic compounds such as sodium arsenite or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood but have been less frequently used due to their toxicity antimony trioxide is a flame retardant aluminium hydroxide has been used as a wood-fibre rubber plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s apart from aluminium hydroxide use of phosphorus based flame-retardantsin the form of for example organophosphatesnow exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types these employ boron antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds
=== glass formation ===
the oxides b2o3 sio2 geo2 as2o3 and sb2o3 readily form glasses teo2 forms a glass but this requires a heroic quench rate or the addition of an impurity otherwise the crystalline form results these compounds are used in chemical domestic and industrial glassware and optics boron trioxide is used as a glass fibre additive and is also a component of borosilicate glass widely used for laboratory glassware and domestic ovenware for its low thermal expansion most ordinary glassware is made from silicon dioxide germanium dioxide is used as a glass fibre additive as well as in infrared optical systems arsenic trioxide is used in the glass industry as a decolourizing and fining agent (for the removal of bubbles) as is antimony trioxide tellurium dioxide finds application in laser and nonlinear optics
amorphous metallic glasses are generally most easily prepared if one of the components is a metalloid or near metalloid such as boron carbon silicon phosphorus or germanium aside from thin films deposited at very low temperatures the first known metallic glass was an alloy of composition au75si25 reported in 1960 a metallic glass having a strength and toughness not previously seen of composition pd82.5p6si9.5ge2 was reported in 2011
phosphorus selenium and lead which are less often recognised as metalloids are also used in glasses phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (p2o5) rather than the silica (sio2) of conventional silicate glasses it is used for example to make sodium lamps selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(ii) oxide (pbo) lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% pbo lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components enamelling sealing and glazing materials and solar cells bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead in many of these applications
=== optical storage and optoelectronics ===
varying compositions of gesbte ("gst alloys") and ag- and in- doped sb2te ("aist alloys") being examples of phase-change materials are widely used in rewritable optical discs and phase-change memory devices by applying heat they can be switched between amorphous (glassy) and crystalline states the change in optical and electrical properties can be used for information storage purposes future applications for gesbte may include ultrafast entirely solid-state displays with nanometre-scale pixels semi-transparent smart glasses smart contact lenses and artificial retina devices.
=== pyrotechnics ===
the recognised metalloids have either pyrotechnic applications or associated properties boron and silicon are commonly encountered they act somewhat like metal fuels boron is used in pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions) and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate boron carbide has been identified as a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions signal flares and fireworks silicon like boron is a component of initiator and delay mixtures doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel arsenic trisulfide as2s3 was used in old naval signal lights in fireworks to make white stars in yellow smoke screen mixtures and in initiator compositions antimony trisulfide sb2s3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions
carbon aluminium phosphorus and selenium continue the theme carbon in black powder is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants bursting charges and effects mixtures and military delay fuses and igniters aluminium is a common pyrotechnic ingredient and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat including in thermite mixtures phosphorus can be found in smoke and incendiary munitions paper caps used in toy guns and party poppers selenium has been used in the same way as tellurium
=== semiconductors and electronics ===
all the elements commonly recognised as metalloids (or their compounds) have been used in the semiconductor or solid-state electronic industries
some properties of boron have limited its use as a semiconductor it has a high melting point single crystals are relatively hard to obtain and introducing and retaining controlled impurities is difficult
silicon is the leading commercial semiconductor it forms the basis of modern electronics (including standard solar cells) and information and communication technologies this was despite the study of semiconductors early in the 20th century having been regarded as the physics of dirt and not deserving of close attention
germanium has largely been replaced by silicon in semiconducting devices being cheaper more resilient at higher operating temperatures and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium alloys and these have been growing in use particularly for wireless communication devices such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium the synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013 this comprises one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms analogous to graphane it conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium and is thought to have potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications the development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014 in the same year lee at al reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on and removed from a germanium substrate
arsenic and antimony are not semiconductors in their standard states both form type iii-v semiconductors (such as gaas alsb or gainassb) in which the average number of valence electrons per atom is the same as that of group 14 elements these compounds are preferred for some special applications antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries
tellurium which is a semiconductor in its standard state is used mainly as a component in type ii/vi semiconducting-chalcogenides these have applications in electro-optics and electronics cadmium telluride (cdte) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency low manufacturing costs and large band gap of 1.44 ev letting it absorb a wide range of wavelengths bismuth telluride (bi2te3) alloyed with selenium and antimony is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation
five metalloidsboron silicon germanium arsenic and antimonycan be found in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals) tellurium is expected to find such use of the less often recognised metalloids phosphorus gallium (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors the commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applicationsin integrated circuits cell phones laser diodes light-emitting diodes photodetectors and solar cells selenium is used in the production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors
boron silicon germanium antimony and tellurium as well as heavier metals and metalloids such as sm hg tl pb bi and se can be found in topological insulators these are alloys or compounds which at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition) are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors cadmium arsenide cd3as2 at about 1 k is a dirac-semimetala bulk electronic analogue of graphenein which electrons travel effectively as massless particles these two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications
== nomenclature and history ==
=== derivation and other names ===
the word metalloid comes from the latin metallum ("metal") and the greek oeides ("resembling in form or appearance") several names are sometimes used synonymously although some of these have other meanings that are not necessarily interchangeable amphoteric element boundary element half-metal half-way element near metal meta-metal semiconductor semimetal and submetal amphoteric element is sometimes used more broadly to include transition metals capable of forming oxyanions such as chromium and manganese half-metal is used in physics to refer to a compound (such as chromium dioxide) or alloy that can act as a conductor and an insulator meta-metal is sometimes used instead to refer to certain metals (be zn cd hg in tl -sn pb) located just to the left of the metalloids on standard periodic tables these metals are mostly diamagnetic and tend to have distorted crystalline structures electrical conductivity values at the lower end of those of metals and amphoteric (weakly basic) oxides semimetal sometimes refers loosely or explicitly to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure electrical conductivity or electronic structure examples include gallium ytterbium bismuth and neptunium the names amphoteric element and semiconductor are problematic as some elements referred to as metalloids do not show marked amphoteric behaviour (bismuth for example) or semiconductivity (polonium) in their most stable forms
=== origin and usage ===
the origin and usage of the term metalloid is convoluted its origin lies in attempts dating from antiquity to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms it was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium) and then more popularly to nonmetals earlier usage in mineralogy to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance can be sourced to as early as 1800 since the mid-20th century it has been used to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements the international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid and suggested using the term semimetal instead use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by atkins et al as it has a different meaning in physicsone that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element the most recent iupac publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal
== elements commonly recognised as metalloids ==
properties noted in this section refer to the elements in their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions
=== boron ===
pure boron is a shiny silver-grey crystalline solid it is less dense than aluminium (2.34 vs 2.70 g/cm3) and is hard and brittle it is barely reactive under normal conditions except for attack by fluorine and has a melting point of 2076 c (cf steel ~1370 c) boron is a semiconductor its room temperature electrical conductivity is 1.5 106 scm1 (about 200 times less than that of tap water) and it has a band gap of about 1.56 ev
the structural chemistry of boron is dominated by its small atomic size and relatively high ionization energy with only three valence electrons per boron atom simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies instead because of its small size and high ionization energies the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral b12 cluster of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra the same motif can be seen as are deltahedral variants or fragments in metal borides and hydride derivatives and in some halides
the bonding in boron has been described as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic covalent network solids (such as diamond) the energy required to transform b c n si and p from nonmetallic to metallic states has been estimated as 30 100 240 33 and 50 kj/mol respectively this indicates the proximity of boron to the metal-nonmetal borderline
most of the chemistry of boron is nonmetallic in nature unlike its heavier congeners it is not known to form a simple b3+ or hydrated [b(h2o)4]3+ cation the small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes and adducts (for example bh3 + co bh3co and similarly fe(co)4 + co fe(co)5) as well as in the geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as [b6h6]2 and [ru6(co)18]2 the aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions given its high charge-to-size ratio boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds the exceptions are the borides as these include depending on their composition covalent ionic and metallic bonding components simple binary compounds such as boron trichloride are lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a lewis base boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry the oxide b2o3 is polymeric in structure weakly acidic and a glass former organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry)
=== silicon ===
silicon is a crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre like boron it is less dense (at 2.33 g/cm3) than aluminium and is hard and brittle it is a relatively unreactive element according to rochow the massive crystalline form (especially if pure) is remarkably inert to all acids including hydrofluoric less pure silicon and the powdered form are variously susceptible to attack by strong or heated acids as well as by steam and fluorine silicon dissolves in hot aqueous alkalis with the evolution of hydrogen as do metals such as beryllium aluminium zinc gallium or indium it melts at 1414 c silicon is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of 104 scm1 and a band gap of about 1.11 ev when it melts silicon becomes a reasonable metal with an electrical conductivity of 1.01.3 104 scm1 similar to that of liquid mercury
the chemistry of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature it is not known to form a cation silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper it shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions the high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon polymeric silicates built up by tetrahedral sio4 units sharing their oxygen atoms are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon the polymeric borates comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral bo3 or bo4 units are built on similar structural principles the oxide sio2 is polymeric in structure weakly acidic and a glass former traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon)
=== germanium ===
germanium is a shiny grey-white solid it has a density of 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle it is mostly unreactive at room temperature but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate na2geo3 and hydrogen gas it melts at 938 c germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 102 scm1 and a band gap of 0.67 ev liquid germanium is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity similar to that of liquid mercury
most of the chemistry of germanium is characteristic of a nonmetal whether or not germanium forms a cation is unclear aside from the reported existence of the ge2+ ion in a few esoteric compounds it can form alloys with metals such as aluminium and gold it shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions germanium generally forms tetravalent (iv) compounds and it can also form less stable divalent (ii) compounds in which it behaves more like a metal germanium analogues of all of the major types of silicates have been prepared the metallic character of germanium is also suggested by the formation of various oxoacid salts a phosphate [(hpo4)2geh2o] and highly stable trifluoroacetate ge(ococf3)4 have been described as have ge2(so4)2 ge(clo4)4 and geh2(c2o4)3 the oxide geo2 is polymeric amphoteric and a glass former the dioxide is soluble in acidic solutions (the monoxide geo is even more so) and this is sometimes used to classify germanium as a metal up to the 1930s germanium was considered to be a poorly conducting metal it has occasionally been classified as a metal by later writers as with all the elements commonly recognised as metalloids germanium has an established organometallic chemistry (see organogermanium chemistry)
=== arsenic ===
arsenic is a grey metallic looking solid it has a density of 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle and moderately hard (more than aluminium less than iron) it is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air which blackens on further exposure arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid it reacts with fused caustic soda to give the arsenate na3aso3 and hydrogen gas arsenic sublimes at 615 c the vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm at 817 c it is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 104 scm1 and a band overlap of 0.5 ev liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15 ev
the chemistry of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear its many metal alloys are mostly brittle it shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions arsenic generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5 the halides and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples in the trivalent state arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties the halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions particularly those of the chloride are reversible with the addition of a hydrohalic acid the oxide is acidic but as noted below (weakly) amphoteric the higher less stable pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties compared to phosphorus the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as aspo4 as2(so4)3 and arsenic acetate as(ch3coo)3 the oxide as2o3 is polymeric amphoteric and a glass former arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry)
=== antimony ===
antimony is a silver-white solid with a blue tint and a brilliant lustre it has a density of 6.697 g/cm3 and is brittle and moderately hard (more so than arsenic less so than iron about the same as copper) it is stable in air and moisture at room temperature it is attacked by concentrated nitric acid yielding the hydrated pentoxide sb2o5 aqua regia gives the pentachloride sbcl5 and hot concentrated sulfuric acid results in the sulfate sb2(so4)3 it is not affected by molten alkali antimony is capable of displacing hydrogen from water when heated 2 sb + 3 h2o sb2o3 + 3 h2 it melts at 631 c antimony is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.1 104 scm1 and a band overlap of 0.16 ev liquid antimony is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of around 5.3 104 scm1
most of the chemistry of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal antimony has some definite cationic chemistry sbo+ and sb(oh)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution the compound sb8(gacl4)2 which contains the homopolycation sb82+ was prepared in 2004 it can form alloys with one or more metals such as aluminium iron nickel copper zinc tin lead and bismuth antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions like arsenic antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5 the halides and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples the +5 state is less stable than the +3 but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic this is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons in comparison the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell tripositive antimony is amphoteric pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15 antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate sb(no3)3 phosphate sbpo4 sulfate sb2(so4)3 and perchlorate sb(clo4)3 the otherwise acidic pentoxide sb2o5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions with the formation of the oxycation sbo+
2 the oxide sb2o3 is polymeric amphoteric and a glass former antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry)
=== tellurium ===
tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid it has a density of 6.24 g/cm3 is brittle and is the softest of the commonly recognised metalloids being marginally harder than sulfur large pieces of tellurium are stable in air the finely powdered form is oxidized by air in the presence of moisture tellurium reacts with boiling water or when freshly precipitated even at 50 c to give the dioxide and hydrogen te + 2 h2o teo2 + 2 h2 it reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide teso3 or tellurous acid h2teo3 the basic nitrate (te2o4h)+(no3) or the oxide sulfate te2o3(so4) it dissolves in boiling alkalis to give the tellurite and telluride 3 te + 6 koh = k2teo3 + 2 k2te + 3 h2o a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature
at higher temperatures tellurium is sufficiently plastic to extrude it melts at 449.51 c crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains the bonding between adjacent atoms in a chain is covalent but there is evidence of a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0 scm1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38 ev liquid tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity on melting of around 1.9 103 scm1 superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor
most of the chemistry of tellurium is characteristic of a nonmetal it shows some cationic behaviour the dioxide dissolves in acid to yield the trihydroxotellurium (iv) te(oh)3+ ion the red te42+ and yellow-orange te62+ ions form when tellurium is oxidized in fluorosulfuric acid (hso3f) or liquid sulfur dioxide (so2) respectively it can form alloys with aluminium silver and tin tellurium shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions tellurium generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 2 +4 or +6 the +4 state is the most stable tellurides of composition xxtey are easily formed with most other elements and represent the most common tellurium minerals nonstoichiometry is pervasive especially with transition metals many tellurides can be regarded as metallic alloys the increase in metallic character evident in tellurium as compared to the lighter chalcogens is further reflected in the reported formation of various other oxyacid salts such as a basic selenate 2teo2seo3 and an analogous perchlorate and periodate 2teo2hxo4 tellurium forms a polymeric amphoteric glass-forming oxide teo2 it is a conditional glass-forming oxideit forms a glass with a very small amount of additive tellurium has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organotellurium chemistry)
== elements less commonly recognised as metalloids ==
=== carbon ===
carbon is ordinarily classified as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally classified as a metalloid hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions it has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor graphite has a layered structure each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement the layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der waals forces and delocalized valence electrons
like a metal the conductivity of graphite in the direction of its planes decreases as the temperature is raised it has the electronic band structure of a semimetal the allotropes of carbon including graphite can accept foreign atoms or compounds into their structures via substitution intercalation or doping the resulting materials are referred to as carbon alloys carbon can form ionic salts including a hydrogen sulfate perchlorate and nitrate (c+
24x.2hx where x = hso4 clo4 and c+
24no
3.3hno3) in organic chemistry carbon can form complex cationstermed carbocationsin which the positive charge is on the carbon atom examples are ch+
3 and ch+
5 and their derivatives
carbon is brittle and behaves as a semiconductor in a direction perpendicular to its planes most of its chemistry is nonmetallic it has a relatively high ionization energy and compared to most metals a relatively high electronegativity carbon can form anions such as c4 (methanide) c2
2 (acetylide) and c3
4 (sesquicarbide or allylenide) in compounds with metals of main groups 13 and with the lanthanides and actinides its oxide co2 forms carbonic acid h2co3
=== aluminium ===
aluminium is ordinarily classified as a metal it is lustrous malleable and ductile and has high electrical and thermal conductivity like most metals it has a close-packed crystalline structure and forms a cation in aqueous solution
it has some properties that are unusual for a metal taken together these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds the oxide al2o3 is amphoteric and a conditional glass-former aluminium can form anionic aluminates such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character
classifying aluminium as a metalloid has been disputed given its many metallic properties it is therefore arguably an exception to the mnemonic that elements adjacent to the metalnonmetal dividing line are metalloids
stott labels aluminium as a weak metal it has the physical properties of a metal but some of the chemical properties of a nonmetal steele notes the paradoxical chemical behaviour of aluminium it resembles a weak metal in its amphoteric oxide and in the covalent character of many of its compounds  yet it is a highly electropositive metal  [with] a high negative electrode potential moody says that aluminium is on the diagonal borderland between metals and non-metals in the chemical sense.
=== selenium ===
selenium shows borderline metalloid or nonmetal behaviour
its most stable form the grey trigonal allotrope is sometimes called metallic selenium because its electrical conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the red monoclinic form the metallic character of selenium is further shown by its lustre and its crystalline structure which is thought to include weakly metallic interchain bonding selenium can be drawn into thin threads when molten and viscous it shows reluctance to acquire the high positive oxidation numbers characteristic of nonmetals it can form cyclic polycations (such as se2+
8) when dissolved in oleums (an attribute it shares with sulfur and tellurium) and a hydrolysed cationic salt in the form of trihydroxoselenium (iv) perchlorate [se(oh)3]+clo
4
the nonmetallic character of selenium is shown by its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~109 to 1012 scm1) of its highly purified form this is comparable to or less than that of bromine (7.951012 scm1) a nonmetal selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form it has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised pauling scale) its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms se2 seo2
3 and seo2
4
selenium is commonly described as a metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature it moves through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony its water-soluble salts in higher concentrations have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic
=== polonium ===
polonium is distinctly metallic in some ways both of its allotropic forms are metallic conductors it is soluble in acids forming the rose-coloured po2+ cation and displacing hydrogen po + 2 h+ po2+ + h2 many polonium salts are known the oxide poo2 is predominantly basic in nature polonium is a reluctant oxidizing agent unlike its lighter congener oxygen highly reducing conditions are required for the formation of the po2 anion in aqueous solution
whether polonium is ductile or brittle is unclear it is predicted to be ductile based on its calculated elastic constants it has a simple cubic crystalline structure such a structure has few slip systems and leads to very low ductility and hence low fracture resistance
polonium shows nonmetallic character in its halides and by the existence of polonides the halides have properties generally characteristic of nonmetal halides (being volatile easily hydrolyzed and soluble in organic solvents) many metal polonides obtained by heating the elements together at 5001,000 c and containing the po2 anion are also known
=== astatine ===
as a halogen astatine tends to be classified as a nonmetal it has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal immediately following its production in 1940 early investigators considered it a metal in 1949 it was called the most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal in 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal in 2013 on the basis of relativistic modelling astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure
several authors have commented on the metallic nature of some of the properties of astatine since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (hvap) greater than ~42 kj/mol are metallic when liquid such elements include boron silicon germanium antimony selenium and tellurium estimated values for hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kj/mol or higher diatomic iodine with a hvap of 41.71 falls just short of the threshold figure
like typical metals it [astatine] is precipitated by hydrogen sulfide even from strongly acid solutions and is displaced in a free form from sulfate solutions it is deposited on the cathode on electrolysis. further indications of a tendency for astatine to behave like a (heavy) metal are  the formation of pseudohalide compounds  complexes of astatine cations  complex anions of trivalent astatine  as well as complexes with a variety of organic solvents it has also been argued that astatine demonstrates cationic behaviour by way of stable at+ and ato+ forms in strongly acidic aqueous solutions
some of astatine's reported properties are nonmetallic it has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302 c bp 337 c) batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for astatine of 0.7 ev this is consistent with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators the chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine which is a halogen and a nonmetal such compounds include astatides (xat) astatates (xato3) and monovalent interhalogen compounds
restrepo et al reported that astatine appeared to be more polonium-like than halogen-like they did so on the basis of detailed comparative studies of the known and interpolated properties of 72 elements
== related concepts ==
=== near metalloids ===
in the periodic table some of the elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character to the left of the metalnonmetal dividing line such elements include gallium tin and bismuth they show unusual packing structures marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric) and amphoterism to the right of the dividing line are carbon phosphorus selenium and iodine they exhibit metallic lustre semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character this applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions carbon as graphite phosphorus as black phosphorus and selenium as grey selenium
=== allotropes ===
different crystalline forms of an element are called allotropes some allotropes particularly those of elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals exhibit more pronounced metallic metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others the existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved
tin for example has two allotropes tetragonal white -tin and cubic grey -tin white tin is a very shiny ductile and malleable metal it is the stable form at or above room temperature and has an electrical conductivity of 9.17 104 scm1 (~1/6th that of copper) grey tin usually has the appearance of a grey micro-crystalline powder and can also be prepared in brittle semi-lustrous crystalline or polycrystalline forms it is the stable form below 13.2 c and has an electrical conductivity of between (25) 102 scm1 (~1/250th that of white tin) grey tin has the same crystalline structure as that of diamond it behaves as a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.08 ev) but has the electronic band structure of a semimetal it has been referred to as either a very poor metal a metalloid a nonmetal or a near metalloid
the diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic being translucent and having a low electrical conductivity of 1014 to 1016 scm1 graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 104 scm1 a figure more characteristic of a metal phosphorus sulfur arsenic selenium antimony and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours
== abundance extraction and cost ==
=== abundance ===
the table gives crustal abundances of the elements commonly to rarely recognised as metalloids some other elements are included for comparison oxygen and xenon (the most and least abundant elements with stable isotopes) iron and the coinage metals copper silver and gold and rhenium the least abundant stable metal (aluminium is normally the most abundant metal) various abundance estimates have been published these often disagree to some extent
=== extraction ===
the recognised metalloids can be obtained by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium b2o3 + 3 mg 2 b + 3mgo after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97% boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds such as bcl3 or bbr3 either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 bx3 + 3 h2 2 b + 6 hx) or to the point of thermal decomposition silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen sio2 + c si + co2 geo2 + 2 h2 ge + 2 h2o arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (feass) or arsenical pyrite (feas2) by heating alternatively it can be obtained from its oxide by reduction with carbon 2 as2o3 + 3 c 2 as + 3 co2 antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron sb2s3 2 sb + 3 fes tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous naoh yielding tellurite then by electrolytic reduction teo2 + 2 naoh na2teo3 + h2o na2teo3 + h2o te + 2 naoh + o2 another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon teo2 + c te + co2
production methods for the elements less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing electrolytic or chemical reduction or irradiation carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide al2o3 in molten cryolite na3alf6 and then by high temperature electrolytic reduction selenium is produced by roasting its coinage metal selenides x2se (x = cu ag au) with soda ash to give the selenite x2se + o2 + na2co3 na2seo3 + 2 x + co2 the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid h2so4 to give selenous acid h2seo3 this is reduced by bubbling with so2 to yield elemental selenium polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth
=== cost ===
the recognised metalloids and their closer neighbours mostly cost less than silver only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold as of 5 april 2014 prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon antimony and tellurium and graphite aluminium and selenium average around one third the cost of silver (us$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce) boron germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver polonium is available for about $100 per microgram which is $100,000,000 a gram zalutsky and pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from two to three times cheaper than the sample price (ge) to nearly three thousand times cheaper (as)
