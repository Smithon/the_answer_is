in biology a mutation is a permanent change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism virus or extrachromosomal dna or other genetic elements mutations result from damage to dna which is not repaired errors in the process of replication or from the insertion or deletion of segments of dna by mobile genetic elements mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including evolution cancer and the development of the immune system including junctional diversity
mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences mutations in genes can either have no effect alter the product of a gene or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely mutations can also occur in nongenic regions one study on genetic variations between different species of drosophila suggests that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene the result is likely to be harmful with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms that have damaging effects and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on genes organisms have mechanisms such as dna repair to prevent or correct mutations by reverting the mutated sequence back to its original state
== descriptionedit ==
mutations can involve the duplication of large sections of dna usually through genetic recombination these duplications are a major source of raw material for evolving new genes with tens to hundreds of genes duplicated in animal genomes every million years most genes belong to larger gene families of shared ancestry known as homology novel genes are produced by several methods commonly through the duplication and mutation of an ancestral gene or by recombining parts of different genes to form new combinations with new functions
here protein domains act as modules each with a particular and independent function that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties for example the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light three for cone cell or color vision and one for rod cell or night vision all four arose from a single ancestral gene another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases engineering redundancy this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding dna
changes in chromosome number may involve even larger mutations where segments of the dna within chromosomes break and then rearrange for example in the homininae two chromosomes fused to produce human chromosome 2 this fusion did not occur in the lineage of the other apes and they retain these separate chromosomes in evolution the most important role of such chromosomal rearrangements may be to accelerate the divergence of a population into new species by making populations less likely to interbreed thereby preserving genetic differences between these populations
sequences of dna that can move about the genome such as transposons make up a major fraction of the genetic material of plants and animals and may have been important in the evolution of genomes for example more than a million copies of the alu sequence are present in the human genome and these sequences have now been recruited to perform functions such as regulating gene expression another effect of these mobile dna sequences is that when they move within a genome they can mutate or delete existing genes and thereby produce genetic diversity
nonlethal mutations accumulate within the gene pool and increase the amount of genetic variation the abundance of some genetic changes within the gene pool can be reduced by natural selection while other more favorable mutations may accumulate and result in adaptive changes
for example a butterfly may produce offspring with new mutations the majority of these mutations will have no effect but one might change the color of one of the butterfly's offspring making it harder (or easier) for predators to see if this color change is advantageous the chance of this butterfly's surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population
neutral mutations are defined as mutations whose effects do not influence the fitness of an individual these can accumulate over time due to genetic drift it is believed that the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect on an organism's fitness also dna repair mechanisms are able to mend most changes before they become permanent mutations and many organisms have mechanisms for eliminating otherwise-permanently mutated somatic cells
beneficial mutations can improve reproductive success
== causesedit ==
four classes of mutations are (1) spontaneous mutations (molecular decay) (2) mutations due to error-prone replication bypass of naturally occurring dna damage (also called error-prone translesion synthesis) (3) errors introduced during dna repair and (4) induced mutations caused by mutagens scientists may also deliberately introduce mutant sequences through dna manipulation for the sake of scientific experimentation
=== spontaneous mutationedit ===
spontaneous mutations on the molecular level can be caused by
tautomerism a base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom altering the hydrogen bonding pattern of that base resulting in incorrect base pairing during replication
depurination loss of a purine base (a or g) to form an apurinic site (ap site)
deamination hydrolysis changes a normal base to an atypical base containing a keto group in place of the original amine group examples include c u and a hx (hypoxanthine) which can be corrected by dna repair mechanisms and 5mec (5-methylcytosine) t which is less likely to be detected as a mutation because thymine is a normal dna base
slipped strand mispairing denaturation of the new strand from the template during replication followed by renaturation in a different spot ("slipping") this can lead to insertions or deletions
=== error-prone replication bypassedit ===
there is increasing evidence that the majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication (translesion synthesis) past a dna damage in the template strand naturally occurring oxidative dna damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times or more per cell per day in rats in mice the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis likewise in yeast kunz et al found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis
=== errors introduced during dna repairedit ===
although naturally occurring double-strand breaks occur at a relatively low frequency in dna their repair often causes mutation non-homologous end joining (nhej) is a major pathway for repairing double-strand breaks nhej involves removal of a few nucleotides to allow somewhat inaccurate alignment of the two ends for rejoining followed by addition of nucleotides to fill in gaps as a consequence nhej often introduces mutations
=== induced mutationedit ===
induced mutations on the molecular level can be caused by:-
chemicals
hydroxylamine
base analogs (e.g. bromodeoxyuridine (brdu))
alkylating agents (e.g. n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea (enu)) these agents can mutate both replicating and non-replicating dna in contrast a base analog can mutate the dna only when the analog is incorporated in replicating the dna each of these classes of chemical mutagens has certain effects that then lead to transitions transversions or deletions
agents that form dna adducts (e.g. ochratoxin a)
dna intercalating agents (e.g. ethidium bromide)
dna crosslinkers
oxidative damage
nitrous acid converts amine groups on a and c to diazo groups altering their hydrogen bonding patterns which leads to incorrect base pairing during replication
radiation
ultraviolet light (uv) (non-ionizing radiation) two nucleotide bases in dnacytosine and thymineare most vulnerable to radiation that can change their properties uv light can induce adjacent pyrimidine bases in a dna strand to become covalently joined as a pyrimidine dimer uv radiation in particular longer-wave uva can also cause oxidative damage to dna
== classification of mutation typesedit ==
=== by effect on structureedit ===
the sequence of a gene can be altered in a number of ways gene mutations have varying effects on health depending on where they occur and whether they alter the function of essential proteins mutations in the structure of genes can be classified as
small-scale mutations such as those affecting a small gene in one or a few nucleotides including
point mutations often caused by chemicals or malfunction of dna replication exchange a single nucleotide for another these changes are classified as transitions or transversions most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (a g) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine (c t) a transition can be caused by nitrous acid base mis-pairing or mutagenic base analogs such as brdu less common is a transversion which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (c/t a/g) an example of a transversion is the conversion of adenine (a) into a cytosine (c) a point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality) point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified into three kinds depending upon what the erroneous codon codes for
silent mutations which code for the same (or a sufficiently similar) amino acid
missense mutations which code for a different amino acid
nonsense mutations which code for a stop codon and can truncate the protein
insertions add one or more extra nucleotides into the dna they are usually caused by transposable elements or errors during replication of repeating elements insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mrna (splice site mutation) or cause a shift in the reading frame (frameshift) both of which can significantly alter the gene product insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element
deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the dna like insertions these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene in general they are irreversible though exactly the same sequence might in theory be restored by an insertion transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 12 bases) in any location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all
large-scale mutations in chromosomal structure including
amplifications (or gene duplications) leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions increasing the dosage of the genes located within them
deletions of large chromosomal regions leading to loss of the genes within those regions
mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of dna potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct fusion genes (e.g. bcr-abl) these include
chromosomal translocations interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes
interstitial deletions an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of dna from a single chromosome thereby apposing previously distant genes for example cells isolated from a human astrocytoma a type of brain tumor were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the fused in glioblastoma (fig) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ros) producing a fusion protein (fig-ros) the abnormal fig-ros fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells)
chromosomal inversions reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment
loss of heterozygosity loss of one allele either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event in an organism that previously had two different alleles
=== by effect on functionedit ===
loss-of-function mutations also called inactivating mutations result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated) when the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele) it is often called an amorphic mutation in the muller's morphs schema phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive exceptions are when the organism is haploid or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency)
gain-of-function mutations also called activating mutations change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function when the new allele is created a heterozygote containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele genetically this defines the mutations as dominant phenotypes often called a neomorphic mutation
dominant negative mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele these mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype in humans dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g. mutations in genes p53 atm cebpa and ppargamma) marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the fbn1 gene located on chromosome 15 which encodes fibrillin-1 a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency
lethal mutations are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms that carry the mutations
a back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype
=== by effect on fitnessedit ===
in applied genetics it is usual to speak of mutations as either harmful or beneficial
a harmful or deleterious mutation decreases the fitness of the organism
a beneficial or advantageous mutation increases the fitness of the organism mutations that promotes traits that are desirable are also called beneficial in theoretical population genetics it is more usual to speak of mutations as deleterious or advantageous than harmful or beneficial
a neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism such mutations occur at a steady rate forming the basis for the molecular clock in the neutral theory of molecular evolution neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level
a nearly neutral mutation is a mutation that may be slightly deleterious or advantageous although most nearly neutral mutations are slightly deleterious
==== distribution of fitness effectsedit ====
attempts have been made to infer the distribution of fitness effects (dfe) using mutagenesis experiments and theoretical models applied to molecular sequence data dfe as used to determine the relative abundance of different types of mutations (i.e. strongly deleterious nearly neutral or advantageous) is relevant to many evolutionary questions such as the maintenance of genetic variation the rate of genomic decay the maintenance of outcrossing sexual reproduction as opposed to inbreeding and the evolution of sex and genetic recombination in summary the dfe plays an important role in predicting evolutionary dynamics a variety of approaches have been used to study the dfe including theoretical experimental and analytical methods
mutagenesis experiment the direct method to investigate the dfe is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects which has already been done in viruses bacteria yeast and drosophila for example most studies of the dfe in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant in escherichia coli one study used transposon mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of tn10 in yeast a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput however given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect dna sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations
molecular sequence analysis with rapid development of dna sequencing technology an enormous amount of dna sequence data is available and even more is forthcoming in the future various methods have been developed to infer the dfe from dna sequence data by examining dna sequence differences within and between species we are able to infer various characteristics of the dfe for neutral deleterious and advantageous mutations to be specific the dna sequence analysis approach allows us to estimate the effects of mutations with very small effects which are hardly detectable through mutagenesis experiments
one of the earliest theoretical studies of the distribution of fitness effects was done by motoo kimura an influential theoretical population geneticist his neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious with a small fraction being neutral hiroshi akashi more recently proposed a bimodal model for the dfe with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations both theories agree that the vast majority of novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations are rare which has been supported by experimental results one example is a study done on the dfe of random mutations in vesicular stomatitis virus out of all mutations 39.6% were lethal 31.2% were non-lethal deleterious and 27.1% were neutral another example comes from a high throughput mutagenesis experiment with yeast in this experiment it was shown that the overall dfe is bimodal with a cluster of neutral mutations and a broad distribution of deleterious mutations
though relatively few mutations are advantageous those that are play an important role in evolutionary changes like neutral mutations weakly selected advantageous mutations can be lost due to random genetic drift but strongly selected advantageous mutations are more likely to be fixed knowing the dfe of advantageous mutations may lead to increased ability to predict the evolutionary dynamics theoretical work on the dfe for advantageous mutations has been done by john h gillespie and h allen orr they proposed that the distribution for advantageous mutations should be exponential under a wide range of conditions which in general has been supported by experimental studies at least for strongly selected advantageous mutations
in general it is accepted that the majority of mutations are neutral or deleterious with rare mutations being advantageous however the proportion of types of mutations varies between species this indicates two important points first the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is likely to vary between species resulting from dependence on effective population size second the average effect of deleterious mutations varies dramatically between species in addition the dfe also differs between coding regions and noncoding regions with the dfe of noncoding dna containing more weakly selected mutations
=== by impact on protein sequenceedit ===
a frameshift mutation is a mutation caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a dna sequence due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame or the grouping of the codons resulting in a completely different translation from the original the earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs the more altered the protein produced is
in contrast any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an in-frame mutation
a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of dna that results in a premature stop codon or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mrna and possibly a truncated and often nonfunctional protein product (see stop codon.)
missense mutations or nonsynonymous mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid this in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional such mutations are responsible for diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa sickle-cell disease and sod1-mediated als
a neutral mutation is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different but chemically similar amino acid the similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein for example a change from aaa to aga will encode arginine a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine
silent mutations are mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein unless the changed amino acid is sufficiently similar to the original they may occur in a region that does not code for a protein or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence the phrase silent mutation is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation however synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former occurring only within exons (and necessarily exactly preserving the amino acid sequence of the protein) synonymous mutations occur due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code
=== by inheritanceedit ===
in multicellular organisms with dedicated reproductive cells mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations which can be passed on to descendants through their reproductive cells and somatic mutations (also called acquired mutations) which involve cells outside the dedicated reproductive group and which are not usually transmitted to descendants
a germline mutation gives rise to a constitutional mutation in the offspring that is a mutation that is present in every cell a constitutional mutation can also occur very soon after fertilisation or continue from a previous constitutional mutation in a parent
the distinction between germline and somatic mutations is important in animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells however it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants which lack dedicated germline the distinction is also blurred in those animals that reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as budding because the cells that give rise to the daughter organisms also give rise to that organism's germline a new mutation that was not inherited from either parent is called a de novo mutation
diploid organisms (e.g. humans) contain two copies of each genea paternal and a maternal allele based on the occurrence of mutation on each chromosome we may classify mutations into three types
a heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele
a homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles
compound heterozygous mutations or a genetic compound comprises two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles
a wild type or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated
=== special classesedit ===
conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain permissive environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain restrictive conditions for example a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition) but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition)
replication timing quantitative trait loci affects dna replication
=== nomenclatureedit ===
in order to categorize a mutation as such the normal sequence must be obtained from the dna of a normal or healthy organism (as opposed to a mutant or sick one) it should be identified and reported ideally it should be made publicly available for a straightforward nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison and agreed upon by the scientific community or by a group of expert geneticists and biologists who have the responsibility of establishing the standard or so-called consensus sequence this step requires a tremendous scientific effort (see dna sequencing.) once the consensus sequence is known the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed described and classified the committee of the human genome variation society (hgvs) has developed the standard human sequence variant nomenclature which should be used by researchers and dna diagnostic centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions in principle this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms the nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes
nucleotide substitution (e.g. 76a>t) the number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5 end the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type in the given example the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine
if it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in genomic dna mitochondrial dna and rna a simple convention is used for example if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from g to c then it would be written as g.100g>c if the mutation occurred in genomic dna m.100g>c if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial dna or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in rna note that for mutations in rna the nucleotide code is written in lower case
amino acid substitution (e.g. d111e) the first letter is the one letter code of the wild-type amino acid the number is the position of the amino acid from the n-terminus and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation nonsense mutations are represented with an x for the second amino acid (e.g d111x)
amino acid deletion (e.g. f508) the greek letter (delta) indicates a deletion the letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the n terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type
== mutation ratesedit ==
mutation rates vary across species evolutionary biologists have theorized that higher mutation rates are beneficial in some situations because they allow populations of organisms to evolve and therefore be adapted more quickly to their environments for example repeated exposure of bacteria to antibiotics and selection of resistant mutants can result in the selection of bacteria that have a much higher mutation rate than the original population (mutator strains)
according to one study two children of different parents had 35 and 49 new mutations of them in one case 92% were from the paternal germline in another case 64% were from the maternal germline
== harmful mutationsedit ==
changes in dna caused by mutation can cause errors in protein sequence creating partially or completely non-functional proteins each cell in order to function correctly depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times when a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body a medical condition can result a condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder some mutations alter a gene's dna base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene one study on the comparison of genes between different species of drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein this will probably be harmful with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding dna of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding dna are deleterious the rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial
if a mutation is present in a germ cell it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation in all of its cells this is the case in hereditary diseases in particular if there is a mutation in a dna repair gene within a germ cell humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer a list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article dna repair-deficiency disorder an example of one is albinism a mutation that occurs in the oca1 or oca2 gene individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers other disorders and have impaired vision on the other hand a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism and certain mutations can cause the cell to become malignant and thus cause cancer
a dna damage can cause an error when the dna is replicated and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that in turn could cause a genetic disorder dna damages are repaired by the dna repair system of the cell each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in dna because dna can be damaged in many ways the process of dna repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease once dna damage has given rise to a mutation the mutation cannot be repaired dna repair pathways can only recognize and act on abnormal structures in the dna once a mutation occurs in a gene sequence it then has normal dna structure and cannot be repaired
== beneficial mutationsedit ==
although mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment in this case the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms or reproduce more quickly in these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection
for example a specific 32 base pair deletion in human ccr5 (ccr5-32) confers hiv resistance to homozygotes and delays aids onset in heterozygotes one possible explanation of the etiology of the relatively high frequency of ccr5-32 in the european population is that it conferred resistance to the bubonic plague in mid-14th century europe people with this mutation were more likely to survive infection thus its frequency in the population increased this theory could explain why this mutation is not found in southern africa which remained untouched by bubonic plague a newer theory suggests that the selective pressure on the ccr5 delta 32 mutation was caused by smallpox instead of the bubonic plague
another example is sickle-cell disease a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance hemoglobin in the red blood cells one-third of all indigenous inhabitants of sub-saharan africa carry the gene because in areas where malaria is common there is a survival value in carrying only a single sickle-cell gene (sickle cell trait) those with only one of the two alleles of the sickle-cell disease are more resistant to malaria since the infestation of the malaria plasmodium is halted by the sickling of the cells that it infests
== prion mutationsedit ==
prions are proteins and do not contain genetic material however prion replication has been shown to be subject to mutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication
== somatic mutationsedit ==
a change in the genetic structure that is not inherited from a parent and also not passed to offspring is called a somatic cell genetic mutation or acquired mutation
cells with heterozygous mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated this kind of mutation happens all the time in living organisms but it is difficult to measure the rate measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer
point mutations may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during dna replication the rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens mutagens can be physical such as radiation from uv rays x-rays or extreme heat or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of dna) mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention
