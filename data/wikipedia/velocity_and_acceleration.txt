angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians (degrees revolutions) through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis when an object rotates about its axis the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle since in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time (t) when dealing with the rotation of an object it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid a body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion so for example parts of its mass are not flying off in a realistic sense all things can be deformable however this impact is minimal and negligible thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as rotational motion
== exampleedit ==
in the example illustrated to the right (or above in some mobile versions)  a particle on object p at a fixed distance r from the origin o rotating counterclockwise it becomes important to then represent the position of particle p in terms of its polar coordinates (r ) in this particular example the value of is changing while the value of the radius remains the same (in rectangular coordinates (x y) both x and y vary with time) as the particle moves along the circle it travels an arc length s which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:
== measurements of angular displacementedit ==
angular displacement may be measured in radians or degrees if using radians it provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle and the distance r from the centre
for example if an object rotates 360 degrees around a circle of radius r the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2r divided by the radius: which easily simplifies to  therefore 1 revolution is radians
when object travels from point p to point q as it does in the illustration to the left over the radius of the circle goes around a change in angle which equals the angular displacement
== three dimensionsedit ==
in three dimensions angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude the direction specifies the axis of rotation which always exists by virtue of the euler's rotation theorem; the magnitude specifies the rotation in radians about that axis (using the right-hand rule to determine direction)
despite having direction and magnitude angular displacement is not a vector because it does not obey the commutative law for addition
=== matrix notationedit ===
given that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix being and two matrices the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as
