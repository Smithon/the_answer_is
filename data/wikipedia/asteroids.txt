asteroids are minor planets especially those of the inner solar system the larger ones have also been called planetoids these terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet as minor planets in the outer solar system were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt in this article the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner solar system including those in co-orbit with jupiter
there are millions of asteroids many thought to be the shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets the large majority of known asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter or are co-orbital with jupiter (the jupiter trojans) however other orbital families exist with significant populations including the near-earth asteroids individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra with the majority falling into three main groups: c-type s-type and m-type these were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich stony and metallic compositions respectively
only one asteroid 4 vesta which has a relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time as of september 2013 the minor planet center had data on more than one million objects in the inner and outer solar system of which 625,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations
on 22 january 2014 esa scientists reported the detection for the first definitive time of water vapor on ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt the detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the herschel space observatory the finding is unexpected because comets not asteroids are typically considered to "sprout jets and plumes" according to one of the scientists "the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids."
== naming ==
a newly discovered asteroid is given a provisional designation (such as 2002 at4) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name (e.g 433 eros) the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g (433) eros) but dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text
=== symbols ===
the first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets by 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols which often occurred in multiple variants
in 1851 after the fifteenth asteroid (eunomia) had been discovered johann franz encke made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch (baj berlin astronomical yearbook) he introduced a disk (circle) a traditional symbol for a star as the generic symbol for an asteroid the circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned to the fifth astraea while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols) the numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers and the next asteroid to be discovered (16 psyche in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery however psyche was given an iconic symbol as well as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above) 20 massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of 37 fides that year astraea's number was increased to  but the first four asteroids ceres to vesta were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition the circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades leading to the modern convention
== discovery ==
the first asteroid to be discovered ceres was found in 1801 by giuseppe piazzi and was originally considered to be a new planet this was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term "asteroid" coined in greek as asteroeids 'star-like star-shaped' from ancient greek astr 'star planet' in the early second half of the nineteenth century the terms "asteroid" and "planet" (not always qualified as "minor") were still used interchangeably; for example the annual of scientific discovery for 1871 page 316 reads "professor j watson has been awarded by the paris academy of sciences the astronomical prize lalande foundation for the discovery of eight new asteroids in one year the planet lydia (no 110) discovered by m borelly at the marseilles observatory [...] m borelly had previously discovered two planets bearing the numbers 91 and 99 in the system of asteroids revolving between mars and jupiter"
=== historical methods ===
asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries
in the last years of the 18th century baron franz xaver von zach organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 au from the sun by the titius-bode law partly because of the discovery by sir william herschel in 1781 of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour readily discernible by observers
the first object ceres was not discovered by a member of the group but rather by accident in 1801 by giuseppe piazzi director of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered a new star-like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights later that year carl friedrich gauss used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object which was found to be between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculture
three other asteroids (2 pallas 3 juno and 4 vesta) were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in 1807 after eight more years of fruitless searches most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches
however karl ludwig hencke persisted and began searching for more asteroids in 1830 fifteen years later he found 5 astraea the first new asteroid in 38 years he also found 6 hebe less than two years later after this other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945) notable asteroid hunters of this early era were j r hind annibale de gasparis robert luther h m s goldschmidt jean chacornac james ferguson norman robert pogson e w tempel j c watson c h f peters a borrelly j palisa the henry brothers and auguste charlois
in 1891 max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates this dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids beginning with 323 brucia whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them calling them "vermin of the skies" a phrase variously attributed to eduard suess and edmund weiss even a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named
=== manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting ===
until 1998 asteroids were discovered by a four-step process first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide-field telescope or astrograph pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope any body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would be measured relative to known star locations
these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a letter representing the half-month of discovery and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: 1998 fj74)
the last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the minor planet center where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit if so the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the international astronomical union
=== computerized methods ===
there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earth's and that could given enough time collide with earth (see earth-crosser asteroids) the three most important groups of near-earth asteroids are the apollos amors and atens various asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed as early as the 1960s
the near-earth asteroid 433 eros had been discovered as long ago as 1898 and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were: 1221 amor 1862 apollo 2101 adonis and finally 69230 hermes which approached within 0.005 au of earth in 1937 astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact
two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of walter alvarez' hypothesis that an impact event resulted in the cretaceouspaleogene extinction and the 1994 observation of comet shoemaker-levy 9 crashing into jupiter the u.s military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across
all these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device (ccd) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes as of spring 2011 it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered a list of teams using such systems includes:
the lincoln near-earth asteroid research (linear) team
the near-earth asteroid tracking (neat) team
spacewatch
the lowell observatory near-earth-object search (loneos) team
the catalina sky survey (css)
the campo imperatore near-earth object survey (cineos) team
the japanese spaceguard association
the asiago-dlr asteroid survey (adas)
the linear system alone has discovered 138,393 asteroids as of 20 september 2013 among all the surveys 4711 near-earth asteroids have been discovered including over 600 more than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter
== terminology ==
traditionally small bodies orbiting the sun were classified as asteroids comets or meteoroids with anything smaller than ten metres across being called a meteoroid the term "asteroid" is ill-defined it never had a formal definition with the broader term minor planet being preferred by the international astronomical union in 2006 the term "small solar system body" was introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets other languages prefer "planetoid" (greek for "planet-like") and this term is occasionally used in english for larger minor planets such as the dwarf planets the word "planetesimal" has a similar meaning but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the solar system was forming the term "planetule" was coined by the geologist william daniel conybeare to describe minor planets but is not in common use the three largest objects in the asteroid belt ceres 2 pallas and 4 vesta grew to the stage of protoplanets ceres is a dwarf planet the only one in the inner solar system
when found asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets and there was no unified term for the two until "small solar system body" was coined in 2006 the main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation a few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity conversely some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroids a further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most "asteroids" with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets
for almost two centuries from the discovery of ceres in 1801 until the discovery of the first centaur 2060 chiron in 1977 all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of jupiter though a few such as 944 hidalgo ventured far beyond jupiter for part of their orbit when astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than jupiter now called centaurs they numbered them among the traditional asteroids though there was debate over whether they should be considered as asteroids or as a new type of object then when the first trans-neptunian object (other than pluto) 1992 qb1 was discovered in 1992 and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: kuiper-belt object trans-neptunian object scattered-disc object and so on these inhabit the cold outer reaches of the solar system where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-neptunian objects were to venture close to the sun their volatile ices would sublimate and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids
the innermost of these are the kuiper-belt objects called "objects" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets they are believed to be predominantly comet-like in composition though some may be more akin to asteroids furthermore most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei (the much more distant oort cloud is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) other recent observations such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the stardust probe are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids suggesting "a continuum between asteroids and comets" rather than a sharp dividing line
the minor planets beyond jupiter's orbit are sometimes also called "asteroids" especially in popular presentations however it is becoming increasingly common for the term "asteroid" to be restricted to minor planets of the inner solar system therefore this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the asteroid belt jupiter trojans and near-earth objects
when the iau introduced the class small solar system bodies in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets they created the class of dwarf planets for the largest minor planetsthose that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity according to the iau "the term 'minor planet' may still be used but generally the term 'small solar system body' will be preferred." currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres at about 950 km (590 mi) across has been placed in the dwarf planet category
== formation ==
it is believed that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the solar nebula until jupiter neared its current mass at which point excitation from orbital resonances with jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately 120 km (75 mi) in diameter accreted during that early era whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the jovian disruption ceres and vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core leaving rocky minerals in the crust
in the nice model many kuiper-belt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt at distances greater than 2.6 au most were later ejected by jupiter but those that remained may be the d-type asteroids and possibly include ceres
== distribution within the solar system ==
various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner solar system their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the yarkovsky effect significant populations include:
=== asteroid belt ===
the majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter generally in relatively low-eccentricity (i.e not very elongated) orbits this belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter and millions of smaller ones these asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by jupiter
=== trojans ===
trojans are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two lagrangian points of stability l4 and l5 which lie 60 ahead of and behind the larger body
the most significant population of trojans are the jupiter trojans although fewer jupiter trojans have been discovered as of 2010 it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt
a couple of trojans have also been found orbiting with mars
=== near-earth asteroids ===
near-earth asteroids or neas are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of earth asteroids that actually cross earth's orbital path are known as earth-crossers as of november 2014 11,600 near-earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter is estimated to be 9001,000
== characteristics ==
=== size distribution ===
asteroids vary greatly in size from almost 70061000000000000001000 km for the largest down to rocks just tens of metres across the three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical have at least partly differentiated interiors and are thought to be surviving protoplanets the vast majority however are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either surviving planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies
the dwarf planet ceres is by far the largest asteroid with a diameter of 975 km (610 mi) the next largest are 2 pallas and 4 vesta both with diameters of just over 500 km (300 mi) vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can on occasion be visible to the naked eye on some rare occasions a near-earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see 99942 apophis
the mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt lying between the orbits of mars and jupiter is estimated to be about 2.870213200000000000003.21021 kg or about 4% of the mass of the moon of this ceres comprises 70209500000000000000.951021 kg a third of the total adding in the next three most massive objects vesta (9%) pallas (7%) and hygiea (3%) brings this figure up to 51%; whereas the three after that 511 davida (1.2%) 704 interamnia (1.0%) and 52 europa (0.9%) only add another 3% to the total mass the number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease
the number of asteroids decreases markedly with size although this generally follows a power law there are 'bumps' at 70035000000000000005 km and 7005100000000000000100 km where more asteroids than expected from a logarithmic distribution are found
==== largest asteroids ====
although their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status the three largest objects ceres vesta and pallas are intact protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets and are atypical compared to the majority of "potato"-shaped asteroids
ceres is the only asteroid with a fully ellipsoidal shape and hence the only one that is a dwarf planet it has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids of around 3.32 and may possess a surface layer of ice like the planets ceres is differentiated: it has a crust a mantle and a core no meteorites from ceres have been found on earth
vesta too has a differentiated interior though it formed inside the solar system's frost line and so is devoid of water; its composition is mainly of basaltic rock such as olivine aside from the large crater at its southern pole rheasilvia vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape vesta is the parent body of the vestian family and other v-type asteroids and is the source of the hed meteorites which constitute 5% of all meteorites on earth
pallas is unusual in that like uranus it rotates on its side with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane its composition is similar to that of ceres: high in carbon and silicon and perhaps partially differentiated pallas is the parent body of the palladian family of asteroids
the fourth-most-massive asteroid hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and unlike the other largest asteroids lies relatively close to the plane of the ecliptic it is the largest member and presumed parent body of the hygiean family of asteroids between them the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt
=== rotation ===
measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit no asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a rotation period smaller than 2.2 hours for asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate the inertia at the surface is greater than the gravitational force so any loose surface material would be flung out however a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly this suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are rubble piles formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids
=== composition ===
the physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle where vesta is thought to have a nickel-iron core olivine mantle and basaltic crust 10 hygiea however which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity though the largest are probably solid some asteroids have moons or are co-orbiting binaries: rubble piles moons binaries and scattered asteroid families are believed to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid
asteroids contain traces of amino acids and other organic compounds and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life or may have even brought life itself to earth (also see panspermia) in august 2011 a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna and rna components (adenine guanine and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space
composition is calculated from three primary sources: albedo surface spectrum and density the last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have so far every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume the investigated asteroids are as large as 280 km in diameter and include 121 hermione (268186183 km) and 87 sylvia (384262232 km) only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 sylvia though none of them have moons; however some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive suggesting they may not have been disrupted and indeed 511 davida the same size as sylvia to within measurement error is estimated to be two and a half times as massive though this is highly uncertain the fact that such large asteroids as sylvia can be rubble piles presumably due to disruptive impacts has important consequences for the formation of the solar system: computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge this means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly
on 7 october 2009 the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of 24 themis using nasas infrared telescope facility the surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice as this ice layer is sublimated it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface organic compounds were also detected on the surface scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the moon the presence of ice on 24 themis supports this theory
in october 2013 water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf gd 61
=== surface features ===
most asteroids outside the "big four" (ceres pallas vesta and hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance if irregular in shape 50-km (31-mi) 253 mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroid's radius and earth-based observations of 300-km (186-mi) 511 davida one of the largest asteroids after the big four reveal a similarly angular profile suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters medium-sized asteroids such as mathilde and 243 ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface of the big four pallas and hygiea are practically unknown vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid ceres seems quite different in the glimpses hubble has provided with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins but details will be expanded with the dawn spacecraft which entered ceres orbit on 6 march 2015
=== color ===
asteroids become darker and redder with age due to space weathering however evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly in the first hundred thousands years limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids
== classification ==
asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits and features of their reflectance spectrum
=== orbital classification ===
many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics apart from the broadest divisions it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past families have only been recognized within the asteroid belt they were first recognized by kiyotsugu hirayama in 1918 and are often called hirayama families in his honor
about 3035% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids a family has also been associated with the plutoid dwarf planet haumea
==== quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====
some asteroids have unusual horseshoe orbits that are co-orbital with earth or some other planet examples are 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29 the first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between saturn's moons epimetheus and janus
sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasi-satellites for a few decades or a few hundred years before returning to their earlier status both earth and venus are known to have quasi-satellites
such objects if associated with earth or venus or even hypothetically mercury are a special class of aten asteroids however such objects could be associated with outer planets as well
=== spectral classification ===
in 1975 an asteroid taxonomic system based on color albedo and spectral shape was developed by clark r chapman david morrison and ben zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material the original classification system had three categories: c-types for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids) s-types for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and u for those that did not fit into either c or s this classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied
the two most widely used taxonomies now used are the tholen classification and smass classification the former was proposed in 1984 by david j tholen and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s this resulted in 14 asteroid categories in 2002 the small main-belt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted in a modified version of the tholen taxonomy with 24 different types both systems have three broad categories of c s and x asteroids where x consists of mostly metallic asteroids such as the m-type there are also several smaller classes
the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals
==== problems ====
originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and a variety of classifications are in use this has led to significant confusion although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials
== exploration ==
until the age of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery the best modern ground-based telescopes and the earth-orbiting hubble space telescope can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star) radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters especially for near-earth asteroids in terms of delta-v and propellant requirements neos are more easily accessible than the moon
the first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971 when the mariner 9 probe imaged phobos and deimos the two small moons of mars which are probably captured asteroids these images revealed the irregular potato-like shapes of most asteroids as did later images from the voyager probes of the small moons of the gas giants
the first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was 951 gaspra in 1991 followed in 1993 by 243 ida and its moon dactyl all of which were imaged by the galileo probe en route to jupiter
the first dedicated asteroid probe was near shoemaker which photographed 253 mathilde in 1997 before entering into orbit around 433 eros finally landing on its surface in 2001
other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include 9969 braille (by deep space 1 in 1999) and 5535 annefrank (by stardust in 2002)
in september 2005 the japanese hayabusa probe started studying 25143 itokawa in detail and was plagued with difficulties but returned samples of its surface to earth on 13 june 2010
the european rosetta probe (launched in 2004) flew by 2867 teins in 2008 and 21 lutetia the third-largest asteroid visited to date in 2010
in september 2007 nasa launched the dawn mission which orbited 4 vesta from july 2011 to september 2012 and is now orbiting the dwarf planet 1 ceres 4 vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date
on 13 december 2012 china's lunar orbiter chang'e 2 flew within 2 miles (3.2 km) of the asteroid 4179 toutatis on an extended mission
=== planned and future missions ===
the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) plans to launch around 2015 the improved hayabusa 2 space probe and to return asteroid samples by 2020 current target for the mission is the c-type asteroid 162173 ryugu
in may 2011 nasa announced the osiris-rex sample return mission to asteroid 1999 rq36 and is expected to launch in 2016
on 15 february 2013 an asteroid measuring approximately 18 metres (59 feet) with a mass of about 9,100 tonnes (10,000 short tons) exploded over chelyabinsk russia causing 1,500 injuries and damaging 7,000 buildings small samples of the rocky chelyabinsk meteorite were quickly recovered and analyzed with a larger fragment found several months later
in early 2013 nasa announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the moon on 19 june 2014 nasa reported that asteroid 2011 md was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission perhaps in the early 2020s
it has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth (asteroid mining) or materials for constructing space habitats (see colonization of the asteroids) materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for space manufacturing and construction
in the u.s discovery program the psyche (spacecraft) proposal to 16 psyche and lucy (spacecraft) to jupiter trojans made it to the semifinalist stage of mission selection
== fiction ==
asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize resources for extracting minerals hazards encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points and as a threat to life on earth by potential impact

== notes ==
^ ceres is the largest asteroid and is now classified as a dwarf planet all other asteroids are now classified as small solar system bodies along with comets centaurs and the smaller trans-neptunian objects
^ neptune also has a few known trojans and these are thought to actually be much more numerous than the jovian trojans however they are often included in the trans-neptunian population rather than counted with the asteroids
