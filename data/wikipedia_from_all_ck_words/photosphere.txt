the photosphere is a star's outer shell from which light is radiated the term itself is derived from ancient greek roots  /phos photos meaning light and /sphaira meaning sphere in reference to the fact that it is a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light it extends into a star's surface until the plasma becomes opaque equivalent to an optical depth of approximately 2/3 in other words a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object usually a star that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths
== temperature ==
the surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the stefanboltzmann law stars excepting neutron stars have no solid surface therefore the photosphere is typically used to describe the sun's or another star's visual surface
== composition ==
the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the sun in the photosphere respectively all heavier elements called metals in astronomy account for less than 2% of the mass with oxygen (roughly 1% of the sun's mass) carbon (0.3%) neon (0.2%) and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant
== sun ==
the sun's photosphere has a temperature between 4,500 and 6,000 k (4,230 and 5,730 c) (with an effective temperature of 5,777 k (5,504 c)) and a density of about 2104 kg/m3 other stars may have hotter or cooler photospheres the sun's photosphere is composed of convection cells called granulescells of plasma each approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the narrow spaces between them each granule has a lifespan of only about eight minutes resulting in a continually shifting boiling pattern grouping the typical granules are super granules up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours these details are too fine to see on other stars
== other layers ==
the sun's visible atmosphere has other layers above the photosphere the 2,000 kilometer-deep chromosphere (typically observed by filtered light for example h-alpha) lies just between the photosphere and the much hotter but more tenuous corona other surface features on the photosphere are solar flares and sunspots
