measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event which can be compared with other objects or events the scope and application of a measurement is dependent on the context and discipline in the natural sciences and engineering measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events which is consistent with the guidelines of the international vocabulary of metrology published by the international bureau of weights and measures however in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences measurements can have multiple levels which would include nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales
measurement is a cornerstone of trade science technology and quantitative research in many disciplines historically many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators since the 18th century developments progressed towards unifying widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern international system of units (si) this system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units the science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology
== methodology ==
the measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria type magnitude unit and uncertainty they enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements
the type or level of measurement is a taxonomy for the methodological character of a comparison for example two states of a property may be compared by ratio difference or ordinal preference the type is commonly not explicitly expressed but implicit in the definition of a measurement procedure the magnitude is the numerical value of the characterization usually obtained with a suitably chosen measuring instrument a unit assigns a mathematical weighting factor to the magnitude that is derived as a ratio to the property of an artifact used as standard or a natural physical quantity an uncertainty represents the random and systemic errors of the measurement procedure it indicates a confidence level in the measurement errors are evaluated by methodically repeating measurements and considering the accuracy and precision of the measuring instrument
== standardization of measurement units ==
measurements most commonly use the international system of units (si) as a comparison framework the system defines seven fundamental units kilogram metre candela second ampere kelvin and mole six of these units are defined without reference to a particular physical object which serves as a standard (artifact-free) with the exception of the kilogram which is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the bipm outside paris
artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a physical constant or other invariable phenomena in nature in contrast to standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction instead the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to
the first proposal to tie an si base unit to an experimental standard independent of fiat was by charles sanders peirce (18391914) who proposed to define the metre in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line this directly influenced the michelsonmorley experiment michelson and morley cite peirce and improve on his method
=== standards ===
with the exception of a few fundamental quantum constants units of measurement are derived from historical agreements nothing inherent in nature dictates that an inch has to be a certain length nor that a mile is a better measure of distance than a kilometre over the course of human history however first for convenience and then for necessity standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain common benchmarks laws regulating measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud in commerce
units of measurement are generally defined on a scientific basis overseen by governmental or independent agencies and established in international treaties pre-eminent of which is the general conference on weights and measures (cgpm) established in 1875 by the treaty of the metre and which oversees the international system of units (si) and which has custody of the international prototype kilogram the metre for example was redefined in 1983 by the cgpm as the distance traveled by light in free space in 1299,792,458 of a second while in 1960 the international yard was defined by the governments of the united states united kingdom australia and south africa as being exactly 0.9144 metres
in the united states the national institute of standards and technology (nist) a division of the united states department of commerce regulates commercial measurements in the united kingdom the role is performed by the national physical laboratory (npl) in australia by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation in south africa by the council for scientific and industrial research and in india the national physical laboratory of india
== units and systems ==
=== imperial and us customary systems ===
before si units were widely adopted around the world the british systems of english units and later imperial units were used in britain the commonwealth and the united states the system came to be known as u.s customary units in the united states and is still in use there and in a few caribbean countries these various systems of measurement have at times been called foot-pound-second systems after the imperial units for length weight and time even though the tons hundredweights gallons and nautical miles for example are different for the u.s units many imperial units remain in use in britain which has officially switched to the si systemwith a few exceptions such as road signs which are still in miles draught beer and cider must be sold by the imperial pint and milk in returnable bottles can be sold by the imperial pint many people measure their height in feet and inches and their weight in stone and pounds to give just a few examples imperial units are used in many other places for example in many commonwealth countries that are considered metricated land area is measured in acres and floor space in square feet particularly for commercial transactions (rather than government statistics) similarly gasoline is sold by the gallon in many countries that are considered metricated
=== metric system ===
the metric system is a decimal systems of measurement based on its units for length the metre and for mass the kilogram it exists in several variations with different choices of base units though these do not affect its day-to-day use since the 1960s the international system of units (si) is the internationally recognised metric system metric units of mass length and electricity are widely used around the world for both everyday and scientific purposes
the metric system features a single base unit for many physical quantities other quantities are derived from the standard si units multiples and fractions of the units are expressed as powers of 10 of each unit unit conversions are always simple because they are in the ratio of ten one hundred one thousand etc. so that convenient magnitudes for measurements are achieved by simply moving the decimal place 1.234 metres is 1234 millimetres or 0.001234 kilometres the use of fractions such as 2/5 of a metre is not prohibited but uncommon all lengths and distances for example are measured in metres or thousandths of a metre (millimetres) or thousands of metres (kilometres) there is no profusion of different units with different conversion factors as in the imperial system which uses for example inches feet yards fathoms rods
=== international system of units ===
the international system of units (abbreviated as si from the french language name systme international d'units) is the modern revision of the metric system it is the world's most widely used system of units both in everyday commerce and in science the si was developed in 1960 from the metre-kilogram-second (mks) system rather than the centimetre-gram-second (cgs) system which in turn had many variants during its development the si also introduced several newly named units that were previously not a part of the metric system the original si units for the seven basic physical quantities were
the mole was subsequently added to this list and the degree kelvin renamed the kelvin
there are two types of si units base units and derived units base units are the simple measurements for time length mass temperature amount of substance electric current and light intensity derived units are constructed from the base units for example the watt i.e the unit for power is defined from the base units as m2kgs3 other physical properties may be measured in compound units such as material density measured in kg/m3
==== converting prefixes ====
the si allows easy multiplication when switching among units having the same base but different prefixes to convert from metres to centimetres it is only necessary to multiply the number of metres by 100 since there are 100 centimetres in a metre inversely to switch from centimetres to metres one multiplies the number of centimetres by 0.01 or divide centimetres by 100
=== length ===
a ruler or rule is a tool used in for example geometry technical drawing engineering and carpentry to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines strictly speaking the ruler is the instrument used to rule straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a measure however common usage calls both instruments rulers and the special name straightedge is used for an unmarked rule the use of the word measure in the sense of a measuring instrument only survives in the phrase tape measure an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines as can be seen in the photographs on this page a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres to easily fit in a pocket and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing
=== some special names ===
some non-systematic names are applied for some multiples of some units
100 kilograms = 1 quintal 1000 kilogram = 1 metric tonne
10 years = 1 decade 100 years = 1 century 1000 years = 1 millennium
=== building trades ===
the australian building trades adopted the metric system in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are metres (m) and millimetres (mm) centimetres (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading plans for example the length two and a half metres is usually recorded as 2500 mm or 2.5 m it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250 cm
=== surveyor's trade ===
american surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by edmund gunter in 1620 the base unit is gunter's chain of 66 feet (20 m) which is subdivided into 4 rods each of 16.5 ft or 100 links of 0.66 feet a link is abbreviated lk, and links lks in old deeds and land surveys done for the government
=== time ===
time is an abstract measurement of elemental changes over a non spatial continuum it is denoted by numbers and/or named periods such as hours days weeks months and years it is an apparently irreversible series of occurrences within this non spatial continuum it is also used to denote an interval between two relative points on this continuum
=== mass ===
mass refers to the intrinsic property of all material objects to resist changes in their momentum weight on the other hand refers to the downward force produced when a mass is in a gravitational field in free fall (no net gravitational forces) objects lack weight but retain their mass the imperial units of mass include the ounce pound and ton the metric units gram and kilogram are units of mass
one device for measuring weight or mass is called a weighing scale or often simply a scale a spring scale measures force but not mass a balance compares weight both require a gravitational field to operate some of the most accurate instruments for measuring weight or mass are based on load cells with a digital read-out but require a gravitational field to function and would not work in free fall
=== economics ===
the measures used in economics are physical measures nominal price value measures and real price measures these measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements
== difficulties ==
since accurate measurement is essential in many fields and since all measurements are necessarily approximations a great deal of effort must be taken to make measurements as accurate as possible for example consider the problem of measuring the time it takes an object to fall a distance of one metre (about 39 in) using physics it can be shown that in the gravitational field of the earth it should take any object about 0.45 second to fall one metre however the following are just some of the sources of error that arise
this computation used for the acceleration of gravity 9.8 metres per second squared (32 ft/s2) but this measurement is not exact but only precise to two significant digits
the earth's gravitational field varies slightly depending on height above sea level and other factors
the computation of 45 seconds involved extracting a square root a mathematical operation that required rounding off to some number of significant digits in this case two significant digits
additionally other sources of experimental error include
carelessness
determining of the exact time at which the object is released and the exact time it hits the ground
measurement of the height and the measurement of the time both involve some error
air resistance
scientific experiments must be carried out with great care to eliminate as much error as possible and to keep error estimates realistic
== definitions and theories ==
=== classical definition ===
in the classical definition which is standard throughout the physical sciences measurement is the determination or estimation of ratios of quantities quantity and measurement are mutually defined quantitative attributes are those possible to measure at least in principle the classical concept of quantity can be traced back to john wallis and isaac newton and was foreshadowed in euclid's elements
=== representational theory ===
in the representational theory measurement is defined as the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers the most technically elaborate form of representational theory is also known as additive conjoint measurement in this form of representational theory numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems a property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established in weaker forms of representational theory such as that implicit within the work of stanley smith stevens numbers need only be assigned according to a rule
the concept of measurement is often misunderstood as merely the assignment of a value but it is possible to assign a value in a way that is not a measurement in terms of the requirements of additive conjoint measurement one may assign a value to a person's height but unless it can be established that there is a correlation between measurements of height and empirical relations it is not a measurement according to additive conjoint measurement theory likewise computing and assigning arbitrary values like the book value of an asset in accounting is not a measurement because it does not satisfy the necessary criteria
=== information theory ===
information theory recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature thus the definition of measurement is a set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity. this definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the mean and statistics of the measurements in practical terms one begins with an initial guess as to the value of a quantity and then using various methods and instruments reduces the uncertainty in the value note that in this view unlike the positivist representational theory all measurements are uncertain so instead of assigning one value a range of values is assigned to a measurement this also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between estimation and measurement
=== quantum mechanics ===
in quantum mechanics a measurement is an action that determines a particular property (position momentum energy etc.) of a quantum system before a measurement is made a quantum system is simultaneously described by all values in a spectrum or range of possible values where the probability of measuring each value is determined by the wavefunction of the system when a measurement is performed the wavefunction of the quantum system collapses to a single definite value the unambiguous meaning of the measurement problem is an unresolved fundamental problem in quantum mechanics
