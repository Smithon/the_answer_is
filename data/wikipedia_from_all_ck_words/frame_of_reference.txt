in physics a frame of reference (or reference frame) consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements
in n dimensions n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame using rectangular (cartesian) coordinates a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes
in einsteinian relativity reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation in this context the phrase often becomes observational frame of reference (or observational reference frame") which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame although not necessarily located at its origin a relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the coordinate time which does not correspond across different frames moving relatively to each other the situation thus differs from galilean relativity where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent
== different aspects of frame of reference"edit ==
the need to distinguish between the various meanings of frame of reference has led to a variety of terms for example sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier as in cartesian frame of reference sometimes the state of motion is emphasized as in rotating frame of reference sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in galilean frame of reference sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations as in macroscopic and microscopic frames of reference
in this article the term observational frame of reference is used when emphasis is upon the state of motion rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus in this sense an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame on the other hand a coordinate system may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern for example a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system in a still broader perspective the formulation of many problems in physics employs generalized coordinates normal modes or eigenvectors which are only indirectly related to space and time it seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below we therefore take observational frames of reference coordinate systems and observational equipment as independent concepts separated as below
an observational frame (such as an inertial frame or non-inertial frame of reference) is a physical concept related to state of motion
a coordinate system is a mathematical concept amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations consequently an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (cartesian polar curvilinear generalized ) to describe observations made from that frame of reference a change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion and so does not entail a change in the observer's observational frame of reference this viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others
choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system
here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames and various associated euclidean three-space coordinate systems [r r etc.]
and this on the utility of separating the notions of and [r r etc.]
and this also on the distinction between and [r r etc.]
and from j d norton
the discussion is taken beyond simple space-time coordinate systems by brading and castellani extension to coordinate systems using generalized coordinates underlies the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations of quantum field theory classical relativistic mechanics and quantum gravity
=== coordinate systemsedit ===
although the term coordinate system is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense the term coordinate system does have a precise meaning in mathematics and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well
a coordinate system in mathematics is a facet of geometry or of algebra in particular a property of manifolds (for example in physics configuration spaces or phase spaces) the coordinates of a point r in an n-dimensional space are simply an ordered set of n numbers
in a general banach space these numbers could be (for example) coefficients in a functional expansion like a fourier series in a physical problem they could be spacetime coordinates or normal mode amplitudes in a robot design they could be angles of relative rotations linear displacements or deformations of joints here we will suppose these coordinates can be related to a cartesian coordinate system by a set of functions
where x y z etc are the n cartesian coordinates of the point given these functions coordinate surfaces are defined by the relations
the intersection of these surfaces define coordinate lines at any selected point tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at that point define a set of basis vectors {e1 e2  en} at that point that is
which can be normalized to be of unit length for more detail see curvilinear coordinates
coordinate surfaces coordinate lines and basis vectors are components of a coordinate system if the basis vectors are orthogonal at every point the coordinate system is an orthogonal coordinate system
an important aspect of a coordinate system is its metric tensor gik which determines the arc length ds in the coordinate system in terms of its coordinates
where repeated indices are summed over
as is apparent from these remarks a coordinate system is a mathematical construct part of an axiomatic system there is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality) however coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate and can be used to describe motion thus lorentz transformations and galilean transformations may be viewed as coordinate transformations
general and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the see also links below
=== observational frames of referenceedit ===
an observational frame of reference often referred to as a physical frame of reference a frame of reference or simply a frame is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer's state of motion here we adopt the view expressed by kumar and barve an observational frame of reference is characterized only by its state of motion however there is lack of unanimity on this point in special relativity the distinction is sometimes made between an observer and a frame according to this view a frame is an observer plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector see doran this restricted view is not used here and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity in general relativity the use of general coordinate systems is common (see for example the schwarzschild solution for the gravitational field outside an isolated sphere)
there are two types of observational reference frame inertial and non-inertial an inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form in special relativity these frames are related by lorentz transformations which are parametrized by rapidity in newtonian mechanics a more restricted definition requires only that newton's first law holds true that is a newtonian inertial frame is one in which a free particle travels in a straight line at constant speed or is at rest these frames are related by galilean transformations these relativistic and newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of representations of the poincar group and of the galilean group
in contrast to the inertial frame a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which fictitious forces must be invoked to explain observations an example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the earth's surface this frame of reference orbits around the center of the earth which introduces the fictitious forces known as the coriolis force centrifugal force and gravitational force (all of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame which is one of free-fall.)
=== measurement apparatusedit ===
a further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the measurement apparatus (for example clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see norton quote above) this question is not addressed in this article and is of particular interest in quantum mechanics where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see measurement problem)
in physics experiments the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the laboratory frame or simply lab frame. an example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest the lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the earth in many physics experiments is not inertial) in particle physics experiments it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured to the center of momentum frame com frame in which calculations are sometimes simplified since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the com frame may be used for making new particles
in this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers measurement equipment in thought in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect metrology that is connected to the nature of the vacuum and uses atomic clocks that operate according to the standard model and that must be corrected for gravitational time dilation (see second meter and kilogram)
in fact einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon for example atoms and molecules

=== simple exampleedit ===
consider a situation common in everyday life two cars travel along a road both moving at constant velocities see figure 1 at some particular moment they are separated by 200 metres the car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second if we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first there are three obvious frames of reference that we could choose
first we could observe the two cars from the side of the road we define our frame of reference s as follows we stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us which happens to be when they are a distance d = 200 m apart since neither of the cars is accelerating we can determine their positions by the following formulas where is the position in meters of car one after time t in seconds and is the position of car two after time t
notice that these formulas predict at t = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us as expected we want to find the time at which  therefore we set and solve for  that is
alternatively we could choose a frame of reference s situated in the first car in this case the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of v2 v1 = 8 m / s in order to catch up to the first car it will take a time of d/v2 v1 = 200/8 s that is 25 seconds as before note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference the third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car that example resembles the case just discussed except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s
it would have been possible to choose a rotating accelerating frame of reference moving in a complicated manner but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily it is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another for example suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time if you know that this is the case when somebody asks you what time it is you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time the measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three when in fact it arrived at three)
=== additional exampleedit ===
for a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers consider two people standing facing each other on either side of a north-south street see figure 2 a car drives past them heading south for the person facing east the car was moving toward the right however for the person facing west the car was moving toward the left this discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system
for a more complex example involving observers in relative motion consider alfred who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right in his frame of reference alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis to him the car moves along the x axis with some velocity v in the positive x-direction alfred's frame of reference is considered an inertial frame of reference because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as earth's rotation and gravity)
now consider betsy the person driving the car betsy in choosing her frame of reference defines her location as the origin the direction to her right as the positive x-axis and the direction in front of her as the positive y-axis in this frame of reference it is betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving for instance as she drives past alfred she observes him moving with velocity v in the negative y-direction if she is driving north then north is the positive y-direction if she turns east east becomes the positive y-direction
finally as an example of non-inertial observers assume candace is accelerating her car as she passes by him alfred measures her acceleration and finds it to be a in the negative x-direction assuming candace's acceleration is constant what acceleration does betsy measure if betsy's velocity v is constant she is in an inertial frame of reference and she will find the acceleration to be the same as alfred in her frame of reference a in the negative y-direction however if she is accelerating at rate a in the negative y-direction (in other words slowing down) she will find candace's acceleration to be a = a a in the negative y-direction - a smaller value than alfred has measured similarly if she is accelerating at rate a in the positive y-direction (speeding up) she will observe candace's acceleration as a = a + a in the negative y-direction a larger value than alfred's measurement
frames of reference are especially important in special relativity because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame the speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference
=== remarksedit ===
it is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference newton for instance employed universal time as explained by the following example suppose that you own two clocks which both tick at exactly the same rate you synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time the two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train traveling at constant velocity towards the other according to newton these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another that is there exists a universal time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity this concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by einstein in his special theory of relativity (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression (lorentz transformations)
it is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional euclidean space newton's assumed a euclidean space but general relativity uses a more general geometry as an example of why this is important let us consider the geometry of an ellipsoid in this geometry a free particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a geodesic path two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface traveling with the same constant speed in different directions after a length of time the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid both free particles traveled with a constant speed satisfying the definition that no forces were acting no acceleration occurred and so newton's first law held true this means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference since no forces were acting it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again in a similar way it is now common to describe that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as spacetime in this picture the curvature of this 4d space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting this curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in newtonian mechanics and special relativity
== non-inertial framesedit ==
here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered the basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces as described below
an accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the primed frame and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes e.g x y a
the vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as r given a point of interest that exists in both frames the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called r and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called r from the geometry of the situation we get
taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time we obtain
where v and a are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system and v and a are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame
these equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems for example we can now write newton's second law as
when there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia if an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking the batteries are recharged illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia however the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration) for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in centrifugal direction or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion the coriolis effect)
a common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a cd which is playing while the player is carried) this arrangement leads to the equation (see fictitious force for a derivation)
or to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame
multiplying through by the mass m gives
where
(euler force)
(coriolis force)
(centrifugal force)
