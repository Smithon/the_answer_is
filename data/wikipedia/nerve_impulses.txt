in physiology an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls following a consistent trajectory action potentials occur in several types of animal cells called excitable cells which include neurons muscle cells and endocrine cells as well as in some plant cells in neurons they play a central role in cell-to-cell communication in other types of cells their main function is to activate intracellular processes in muscle cells for example an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction in beta cells of the pancreas they provoke release of insulin action potentials in neurons are also known as "nerve impulses" or "spikes" and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "spike train" a neuron that emits an action potential is often said to "fire"
action potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell's plasma membrane these channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the resting potential of the cell but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold value when the channels open (in response to depolarization in transmembrane voltage) they allow an inward flow of sodium ions which changes the electrochemical gradient which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential this then causes more channels to open producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on the process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential the rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate as the sodium channels close sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron and then they are actively transported back out of the plasma membrane potassium channels are then activated and there is an outward current of potassium ions returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state after an action potential has occurred there is a transient negative shift called the afterhyperpolarization or refractory period due to additional potassium currents this mechanism prevents an action potential from traveling back the way it just came
in animal cells there are two primary types of action potentials one type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels the other by voltage-gated calcium channels sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond whereas calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer in some types of neurons slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes in cardiac muscle cells on the other hand an initial fast sodium spike provides a "primer" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike which then produces muscle contraction
== overview ==
nearly all cell membranes in animals plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell called the membrane potential a typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is 70 mv; this means that the interior of the cell has a negative voltage of approximately one-fifteenth of a volt relative to the exterior in most types of cells the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant some types of cells however are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time in some types of electrically active cells including neurons and muscle cells the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall these up-and-down cycles are known as action potentials in some types of neurons the entire up-and-down cycle takes place in a few thousandths of a second in muscle cells a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second in some other types of cells and in plants an action potential may last three seconds or more
the electrical properties of a cell are determined by the structure of the membrane that surrounds it a cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer of molecules in which larger protein molecules are embedded the lipid bilayer is highly resistant to movement of electrically charged ions so it functions as an insulator the large membrane-embedded proteins in contrast provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell these voltage-sensitive proteins are known as voltage-gated ion channels
=== process in a typical neuron ===
all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized in other words they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's plasma membrane known as the membrane potential this electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels in neurons the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell giving the dendrites axon and cell body different electrical properties as a result some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials) whereas others are not recent studies have shown that the most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the axon hillock (the point where the axon leaves the cell body) which is called the initial segment but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases
each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential: the resting potential which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell and a higher value called the threshold potential at the axon hillock of a typical neuron the resting potential is around 70 millivolts (mv) and the threshold potential is around 55 mv synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold when an action potential is triggered the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward often ending below the resting level where it remains for some period of time the shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell (exceptions are discussed later in the article.) in most neurons the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10100 per second; some types however are much quieter and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials
== biophysical basis ==
action potentials result from the presence in a cell's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties:
it is capable of assuming more than one conformation
at least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions
the transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential
thus a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential and closed for others in most cases however the relationship between membrane potential and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times: the membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition
voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops: the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus in some situations a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle proceeds explosively the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels that are capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential exist voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels each of these types comes in multiple variants with different voltage sensitivity and different temporal dynamics
the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction these are sometimes known as hodgkin-huxley sodium channels because they were first characterized by alan hodgkin and andrew huxley in their nobel prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential but can more conveniently be referred to as nav channels (the "v" stands for "voltage".) an nav channel has three possible states known as deactivated activated and inactivated the channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the activated state when the membrane potential is low the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated (closed) state if the membrane potential is raised above a certain level the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated (open) state the higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation once a channel has activated it will eventually transition to the inactivated (closed) state it tends then to stay inactivated for some time but if the membrane potential becomes low again the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state during an action potential most channels of this type go through a cycle deactivatedactivatedinactivateddeactivated this is only the population average behavior however an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time however the likelihood of a channel's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the activated state is very low: a channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state
the outcome of all this is that the kinetics of the nav channels are governed by a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way since these channels themselves play a major role in determining the voltage the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out hodgkin and huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states known as the hodgkin-huxley equations these equations have been extensively modified by later research but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics
as the membrane potential is increased sodium ion channels open allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell this is followed by the opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell the inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's resting potential the sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential while potassium continues to leave the cell the efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell for small voltage increases from rest the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value typically 70 mv however if the voltage increases past a critical threshold typically 15 mv higher than the resting value the sodium current dominates this results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels thus the cell fires producing an action potential the frequency at which cellular action potentials are produced is known as its firing rate
currents produced by the opening of voltage-gated channels in the course of an action potential are typically significantly larger than the initial stimulating current thus the amplitude duration and shape of the action potential are determined largely by the properties of the excitable membrane and not the amplitude or duration of the stimulus this all-or-nothing property of the action potential sets it apart from graded potentials such as receptor potentials electrotonic potentials and synaptic potentials which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus a variety of action potential types exist in many cell types and cell compartments as determined by the types of voltage-gated channels leak channels channel distributions ionic concentrations membrane capacitance temperature and other factors
the principal ions involved in an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell and potassium ions leave restoring equilibrium relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically the ions exchanged during an action potential therefore make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations the few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continuous action of the sodiumpotassium pump which with other ion transporters maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane calcium cations and chloride anions are involved in a few types of action potentials such as the cardiac action potential and the action potential in the single-cell alga acetabularia respectively
although action potentials are generated locally on patches of excitable membrane the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane precipitating a domino-like propagation in contrast to passive spread of electric potentials (electrotonic potential) action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and propagate without decay myelinated sections of axons are not excitable and do not produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as electrotonic potential regularly spaced unmyelinated patches called the nodes of ranvier generate action potentials to boost the signal known as saltatory conduction this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter depolarization of axon terminals in general triggers the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft in addition backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons which are ubiquitous in the neocortex these are thought to have a role in spike-timing-dependent plasticity
== neurotransmission ==
=== anatomy of a neuron ===
several types of cells support an action potential such as plant cells muscle cells and the specialized cells of the heart (in which occurs the cardiac action potential) however the main excitable cell is the neuron which also has the simplest mechanism for the action potential
neurons are electrically excitable cells composed in general of one or more dendrites a single soma a single axon and one or more axon terminals dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals their protrusions or spines are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron they have a high concentration of ligand-gated ion channels these spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite this ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines the dendritic spine can with rare exception (see ltp) act as an independent unit the dendrites extend from the soma which houses the nucleus and many of the "normal" eukaryotic organelles unlike the spines the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels these channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites emerging out from the soma is the axon hillock this region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels in general it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials multiple signals generated at the spines and transmitted by the soma all converge here immediately after the axon hillock is the axon this is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma the axon is insulated by a myelin sheath myelin is composed of either schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system) both of which are types of glial cells although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons to be specific myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon this insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed this insulation however has the restriction that no channels can be present on the surface of the axon there are therefore regularly spaced patches of membrane which have no insulation these nodes of ranvier can be considered to be "mini axon hillocks" as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay at the furthest end the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals these presynaptic terminals or synaptic boutons are a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles
=== initiation ===
before considering the propagation of action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs it is helpful to consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the axon hillock the basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing there are several ways in which this depolarization can occur
=== dynamics ===
action potentials are most commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from a presynaptic neuron typically neurotransmitter molecules are released by the presynaptic neuron these neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell this binding opens various types of ion channels this opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the cell membrane and thus the membrane potential if the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane) the synapse is excitatory if however the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane) it is inhibitory whether the voltage is increased or decreased the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the cable equation and its refinements) typically the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with the distance from the synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the axon hillock and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential more typically the excitatory potentials from several synapses must work together at nearly the same time to provoke a new action potential their joint efforts can be thwarted however by the counteracting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
neurotransmission can also occur through electrical synapses due to the direct connection between excitable cells in the form of gap junctions an action potential can be transmitted directly from one cell to the next in either direction the free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical-mediated transmission rectifying channels ensure that action potentials move only in one direction through an electrical synapse electrical synapses are found in all nervous systems including the human brain although they are a distinct minority
=== "all-or-none" principle ===
the amplitude of an action potential is independent of the amount of current that produced it in other words larger currents do not create larger action potentials therefore action potentials are said to be all-or-none signals since either they occur fully or they do not occur at all this is in contrast to receptor potentials whose amplitudes are dependent on the intensity of a stimulus in both cases the frequency of action potentials is correlated with the intensity of a stimulus
=== sensory neurons ===
in sensory neurons an external signal such as pressure temperature light or sound is coupled with the opening and closing of ion channels which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage these voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and in some sensory neurons their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and meissner's corpuscle which are critical for the sense of smell and touch respectively however not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon instead they may convert the signal into the release of a neurotransmitter or into continuous graded potentials either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential for illustration in the human ear hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released in similar manner in the human retina the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer the ganglion cells produce action potentials which then travel up the optic nerve
=== pacemaker potentials ===
in sensory neurons action potentials result from an external stimulus however some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: they spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate like an internal clock the voltage traces of such cells are known as pacemaker potentials the cardiac pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves the external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing but merely alter its timing in some cases the regulation of frequency can be more complex leading to patterns of action potentials such as bursting
== phases ==
the course of the action potential can be divided into five parts: the rising phase the peak phase the falling phase the undershoot phase and the refractory period during the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive) the point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase at this stage the membrane potential reaches a maximum subsequent to this there is a falling phase during this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative returning towards resting potential the undershoot or afterhyperpolarization phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized) finally the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the refractory period which may overlap with the other phases
the course of the action potential is determined by two coupled effects first voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response to changes in the membrane voltage vm this changes the membrane's permeability to those ions second according to the goldman equation this change in permeability changes in the equilibrium potential em and thus the membrane voltage vm thus the membrane potential affects the permeability which then further affects the membrane potential this sets up the possibility for positive feedback which is a key part of the rising phase of the action potential a complicating factor is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal "gates" that respond to changes in vm in opposite ways or at different rates for example although raising vm opens most gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel it also closes the channel's "inactivation gate" albeit more slowly hence when vm is raised suddenly the sodium channels open initially but then close due to the slower inactivation
the voltages and currents of the action potential in all of its phases were modeled accurately by alan lloyd hodgkin and andrew huxley in 1952 for which they were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1963 however their model considers only two types of voltage-sensitive ion channels and makes several assumptions about them e.g. that their internal gates open and close independently of one another in reality there are many types of ion channels and they do not always open and close independently
=== stimulation and rising phase ===
a typical action potential begins at the axon hillock with a sufficiently strong depolarization e.g. a stimulus that increases vm this depolarization is often caused by the injection of extra sodium cations into the cell; these cations can come from a wide variety of sources such as chemical synapses sensory neurons or pacemaker potentials
for a neuron at rest there is a high concentration of sodium and chlorine ions in the extracellular fluid compared to the intracellular fluid while there is a high concentration of potassium ions in the intracellular fluid compared to the extracellular fluid this concentration gradient along with potassium leak channels present on the membrane of the neuron causes an efflux of potassium ions making the resting potential close to ek 75 mv the depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane allowing the ions to flow into and out of the axon respectively if the depolarization is small (say increasing vm from 70 mv to 60 mv) the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around 70 mv.however if the depolarization is large enough the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition (positive feedback) results: the more inward current there is the more vm increases which in turn further increases the inward current a sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in vm) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives vm closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ena +55 mv the increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open which pushes vm still further towards ena this positive feedback continues until the sodium channels are fully open and vm is close to ena the sharp rise in vm and sodium permeability correspond to the rising phase of the action potential
the critical threshold voltage for this runaway condition is usually around 45 mv but it depends on the recent activity of the axon a membrane that has just fired an action potential cannot fire another one immediately since the ion channels have not returned to the deactivated state the period during which no new action potential can be fired is called the absolute refractory period at longer times after some but not all of the ion channels have recovered the axon can be stimulated to produce another action potential but with a higher threshold requiring a much stronger depolarization e.g. to 30 mv the period during which action potentials are unusually difficult to evoke is called the relative refractory period
=== peak and falling phase ===
the positive feedback of the rising phase slows and comes to a halt as the sodium ion channels become maximally open at the peak of the action potential the sodium permeability is maximized and the membrane voltage vm is nearly equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage ena however the same raised voltage that opened the sodium channels initially also slowly shuts them off by closing their pores; the sodium channels become inactivated this lowers the membrane's permeability to sodium relative to potassium driving the membrane voltage back towards the resting value at the same time the raised voltage opens voltage-sensitive potassium channels; the increase in the membrane's potassium permeability drives vm towards ek combined these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause vm to drop quickly repolarizing the membrane and producing the "falling phase" of the action potential
=== afterhyperpolarization ===
the raised voltage opened many more potassium channels than usual and some of these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage in addition further potassium channels open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential the potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high driving the membrane voltage vm even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage ek hence there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization termed an afterhyperpolarization in technical language that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value
=== refractory period ===
each action potential is followed by a refractory period which can be divided into an absolute refractory period during which it is impossible to evoke another action potential and then a relative refractory period during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required these two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules when closing after an action potential sodium channels enter an "inactivated" state in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potentialthis gives rise to the absolute refractory period even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open making it difficult for the membrane potential to depolarize and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable
the absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons at any given moment the patch of axon behind the actively spiking part is refractory but the patch in front not having been activated recently is capable of being stimulated by the depolarization from the action potential
== propagation ==
the action potential generated at the axon hillock propagates as a wave along the axon the currents flowing inwards at a point on the axon during an action potential spread out along the axon and depolarize the adjacent sections of its membrane if sufficiently strong this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches this basic mechanism was demonstrated by alan lloyd hodgkin in 1937 after crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials he showed that an action potential arriving on one side of the block could provoke another action potential on the other provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short
once an action potential has occurred at a patch of membrane the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again at the molecular level this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation i.e. to return to their closed state there are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons some of them inactivate fast (a-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization on the other hand all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state although it limits the frequency of firing the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon the currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon however only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part in the usual orthodromic conduction the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite directionknown as antidromic conductionis very rare however if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle both halves of the axon are "fresh" i.e. unfired; then two action potentials will be generated one traveling towards the axon hillock and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs
=== myelin and saltatory conduction ===
in order to enable fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system certain neuronal axons are covered with myelin sheaths myelin is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as nodes of ranvier it is produced by specialized cells: schwann cells exclusively in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes exclusively in the central nervous system myelin sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals thus allowing a fast saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node myelination is found mainly in vertebrates but an analogous system has been discovered in a few invertebrates such as some species of shrimp not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; for example axons of the neurons comprising the autonomous nervous system are not in general myelinated
myelin prevents ions from entering or leaving the axon along myelinated segments as a general rule myelination increases the conduction velocity of action potentials and makes them more energy-efficient whether saltatory or not the mean conduction velocity of an action potential ranges from 1 meter per second (m/s) to over 100 m/s and in general increases with axonal diameter
action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane in myelinated segments of the axon however the current is carried by the cytoplasm which is sufficient to depolarize the first or second subsequent node of ranvier instead the ionic current from an action potential at one node of ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent "hopping" of the action potential from node to node is known as saltatory conduction although the mechanism of saltatory conduction was suggested in 1925 by ralph lillie the first experimental evidence for saltatory conduction came from ichiji tasaki and taiji takeuchi and from andrew huxley and robert stmpfli by contrast in unmyelinated axons the action potential provokes another in the membrane immediately adjacent and moves continuously down the axon like a wave
myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency for axons larger than a minimum diameter (roughly 1 micrometre) myelination increases the conduction velocity of an action potential typically tenfold conversely for a given conduction velocity myelinated fibers are smaller than their unmyelinated counterparts for example action potentials move at roughly the same speed (25 m/s) in a myelinated frog axon and an unmyelinated squid giant axon but the frog axon has a roughly 30-fold smaller diameter and 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area also since the ionic currents are confined to the nodes of ranvier far fewer ions "leak" across the membrane saving metabolic energy this saving is a significant selective advantage since the human nervous system uses approximately 20% of the body's metabolic energy
the length of axons' myelinated segments is important to the success of saltatory conduction they should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of ranvier in nature myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node thus the safety factor of saltatory conduction is high allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury however action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the safety factor is low even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the branch point of an axon where it divides into two axons
some diseases degrade myelin and impair saltatory conduction reducing the conduction velocity of action potentials the most well-known of these is multiple sclerosis in which the breakdown of myelin impairs coordinated movement
=== cable theory ===
the flow of currents within an axon can be described quantitatively by cable theory and its elaborations such as the compartmental model cable theory was developed in 1855 by lord kelvin to model the transatlantic telegraph cable and was shown to be relevant to neurons by hodgkin and rushton in 1946 in simple cable theory the neuron is treated as an electrically passive perfectly cylindrical transmission cable which can be described by a partial differential equation
where v(x t) is the voltage across the membrane at a time t and a position x along the length of the neuron and where and are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus referring to the circuit diagram on the right these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length
these time and length-scales can be used to understand the dependence of the conduction velocity on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers for example the time-scale increases with both the membrane resistance rm and capacitance cm as the capacitance increases more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by the equation q=cv); as the resistance increases less charge is transferred per unit time making the equilibration slower in similar manner if the internal resistance per unit length ri is lower in one axon than in another (e.g. because the radius of the former is larger) the spatial decay length becomes longer and the conduction velocity of an action potential should increase if the transmembrane resistance rm is increased that lowers the average "leakage" current across the membrane likewise causing to become longer increasing the conduction velocity
== termination ==
=== chemical synapses ===
in general action potentials that reach the synaptic knobs cause a neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft neurotransmitters are small molecules that may open ion channels in the postsynaptic cell; most axons have the same neurotransmitter at all of their termini the arrival of the action potential opens voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane; the influx of calcium causes vesicles filled with neurotransmitter to migrate to the cell's surface and release their contents into the synaptic cleft this complex process is inhibited by the neurotoxins tetanospasmin and botulinum toxin which are responsible for tetanus and botulism respectively
=== electrical synapses ===
some synapses dispense with the "middleman" of the neurotransmitter and connect the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells together when an action potential reaches such a synapse the ionic currents flowing into the presynaptic cell can cross the barrier of the two cell membranes and enter the postsynaptic cell through pores known as connexons thus the ionic currents of the presynaptic action potential can directly stimulate the postsynaptic cell electrical synapses allow for faster transmission because they do not require the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft hence electrical synapses are used whenever fast response and coordination of timing are crucial as in escape reflexes the retina of vertebrates and the heart
=== neuromuscular junctions ===
a special case of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction in which the axon of a motor neuron terminates on a muscle fiber in such cases the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine which binds to the acetylcholine receptor an integral membrane protein in the membrane (the sarcolemma) of the muscle fiber however the acetylcholine does not remain bound; rather it dissociates and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase located in the synapse this enzyme quickly reduces the stimulus to the muscle which allows the degree and timing of muscular contraction to be regulated delicately some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase to prevent this control such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun and the insecticides diazinon and malathion
== other cell types ==
=== cardiac action potentials ===
the cardiac action potential differs from the neuronal action potential by having an extended plateau in which the membrane is held at a high voltage for a few hundred milliseconds prior to being repolarized by the potassium current as usual this plateau is due to the action of slower calcium channels opening and holding the membrane voltage near their equilibrium potential even after the sodium channels have inactivated
the cardiac action potential plays an important role in coordinating the contraction of the heart the cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart the action potentials of those cells propagate to and through the atrioventricular node (av node) which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles action potentials from the av node travel through the bundle of his and thence to the purkinje fibers conversely anomalies in the cardiac action potentialwhether due to a congenital mutation or injurycan lead to human pathologies especially arrhythmias several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential such as quinidine lidocaine beta blockers and verapamil
=== muscular action potentials ===
the action potential in a normal skeletal muscle cell is similar to the action potential in neurons action potentials result from the depolarization of the cell membrane (the sarcolemma) which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; these become inactivated and the membrane is repolarized through the outward current of potassium ions the resting potential prior to the action potential is typically 90mv somewhat more negative than typical neurons the muscle action potential lasts roughly 24 ms the absolute refractory period is roughly 13 ms and the conduction velocity along the muscle is roughly 5 m/s the action potential releases calcium ions that free up the tropomyosin and allow the muscle to contract muscle action potentials are provoked by the arrival of a pre-synaptic neuronal action potential at the neuromuscular junction which is a common target for neurotoxins
=== plant action potentials ===
plant and fungal cells are also electrically excitable the fundamental difference to animal action potentials is that the depolarization in plant cells is not accomplished by an uptake of positive sodium ions but by release of negative chloride ions together with the following release of positive potassium ions which is common to plant and animal action potentials the action potential in plants infers therefore an osmotic loss of salt (kcl) whereas the animal action potential is osmotically neutral when equal amounts of entering sodium and leaving potassium cancel each other osmotically the interaction of electrical and osmotic relations in plant cells indicates an osmotic function of electrical excitability in the common unicellular ancestors of plants and animals under changing salinity conditions whereas the present function of rapid signal transmission is seen as a younger accomplishment of metazoan cells in a more stable osmotic environment it must be assumed that the familiar signalling function of action potentials in some vascular plants (e.g mimosa pudica) arose independently from that in metazoan excitable cells

action potentials are found throughout multicellular organisms including plants invertebrates such as insects and vertebrates such as reptiles and mammals sponges seem to be the main phylum of multicellular eukaryotes that does not transmit action potentials although some studies have suggested that these organisms have a form of electrical signaling too the resting potential as well as the size and duration of the action potential have not varied much with evolution although the conduction velocity does vary dramatically with axonal diameter and myelination
given its conservation throughout evolution the action potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages one function of action potentials is rapid long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 m/s which is one-third the speed of sound for comparison a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8 m/s in large arteries part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events such as the contraction of the heart a second function is the computation associated with its generation being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics the integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation one that has been exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks
== experimental methods ==
the study of action potentials has required the development of new experimental methods the initial work prior to 1955 focused on three goals: isolating signals from single neurons or axons developing fast sensitive electronics and shrinking electrodes enough that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded
the first problem was solved by studying the giant axons found in the neurons of the squid genus loligo these axons are so large in diameter (roughly 1 mm or 100-fold larger than a typical neuron) that they can be seen with the naked eye making them easy to extract and manipulate however the loligo axons are not representative of all excitable cells and numerous other systems with action potentials have been studied
the second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the voltage clamp which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation and eliminated a key source of electronic noise the current ic associated with the capacitance c of the membrane since the current equals c times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage vm the solution was to design a circuit that kept vm fixed (zero rate of change) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane thus the current required to keep vm at a fixed value is a direct reflection of the current flowing through the membrane other electronic advances included the use of faraday cages and electronics with high input impedance so that the measurement itself did not affect the voltage being measured
the third problem that of obtaining electrodes small enough to record voltages within a single axon without perturbing it was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropipette electrode which was quickly adopted by other researchers refinements of this method are able to produce electrode tips that are as fine as 100 (10 nm) which also confers high input impedance action potentials may also be recorded with small metal electrodes placed just next to a neuron with neurochips containing eosfets or optically with dyes that are sensitive to ca2+ or to voltage
while glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the patch clamp by erwin neher and bert sakmann for this they were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1991 patch-clamping verified that ionic channels have discrete states of conductance such as open closed and inactivated
optical imaging technologies have been developed in recent years to measure action potentials either via simultaneous multisite recordings or with ultra-spatial resolution using voltage-sensitive dyes action potentials have been optically recorded from a tiny patch of cardiomyocyte membrane
== neurotoxins ==
several neurotoxins both natural and synthetic are designed to block the action potential tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the gonyaulax (the dinoflagellate genus responsible for "red tides") block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel; similarly dendrotoxin from the black mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose by allowing scientists to "turn off" specific channels at will thus isolating the other channels' contributions; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration however such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins and have been considered for use as chemical weapons neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides; one example is the synthetic permethrin which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials the ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans many other neurotoxins interfere with the transmission of the action potential's effects at the synapses especially at the neuromuscular junction
== history ==
the role of electricity in the nervous systems of animals was first observed in dissected frogs by luigi galvani who studied it from 1791 to 1797 galvani's results stimulated alessandro volta to develop the voltaic pilethe earliest-known electric batterywith which he studied animal electricity (such as electric eels) and the physiological responses to applied direct-current voltages
scientists of the 19th century studied the propagation of electrical signals in whole nerves (i.e. bundles of neurons) and demonstrated that nervous tissue was made up of cells instead of an interconnected network of tubes (a reticulum) carlo matteucci followed up galvani's studies and demonstrated that cell membranes had a voltage across them and could produce direct current matteucci's work inspired the german physiologist emil du bois-reymond who discovered the action potential in 1848 the conduction velocity of action potentials was first measured in 1850 by du bois-reymond's friend hermann von helmholtz to establish that nervous tissue is made up of discrete cells the spanish physician santiago ramn y cajal and his students used a stain developed by camillo golgi to reveal the myriad shapes of neurons which they rendered painstakingly for their discoveries golgi and ramn y cajal were awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physiology their work resolved a long-standing controversy in the neuroanatomy of the 19th century; golgi himself had argued for the network model of the nervous system
the 20th century was a golden era for electrophysiology in 1902 and again in 1912 julius bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeability of the axonal membrane to ions bernstein's hypothesis was confirmed by ken cole and howard curtis who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential in 1907 louis lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances in 1949 alan hodgkin and bernard katz refined bernstein's hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions; in particular they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential they made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential this line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of hodgkin katz and andrew huxley in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively hodgkin and huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states including "open" "closed" and "inactivated" their hypotheses were confirmed in the mid-1970s and 1980s by erwin neher and bert sakmann who developed the technique of patch clamping to examine the conductance states of individual ion channels in the 21st century researchers are beginning to understand the structural basis for these conductance states and for the selectivity of channels for their species of ion through the atomic-resolution crystal structures fluorescence distance measurements and cryo-electron microscopy studies
julius bernstein was also the first to introduce the nernst equation for resting potential across the membrane; this was generalized by david e goldman to the eponymous goldman equation in 1943 the sodiumpotassium pump was identified in 1957 and its properties gradually elucidated culminating in the determination of its atomic-resolution structure by x-ray crystallography the crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved giving a broader view of how these molecular machines work
== quantitative models ==
mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential and offer predictions that may be tested against experimental data providing a stringent test of a theory the most important and accurate of the early neural models is the hodgkinhuxley model which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four ordinary differential equations (odes) although the hodgkinhuxley model may be a simplification with few limitations compared to the realistic nervous membrane as it exists in nature its complexity has inspired several even-more-simplified models such as the morrislecar model and the fitzhughnagumo model both of which have only two coupled odes the properties of the hodgkinhuxley and fitzhughnagumo models and their relatives such as the bonhoeffervan der pol model have been well-studied within mathematics computation and electronics however the simple models of generator potential and action potential fail to accurately reproduce the near threshold neural spike rate and spike shape specifically for the mechanoreceptors like the pacinian corpuscle more modern research has focused on larger and more integrated systems; by joining action-potential models with models of other parts of the nervous system (such as dendrites and synapses) researchers can study neural computation and simple reflexes such as escape reflexes and others controlled by central pattern generators

== notes ==
^ in general while this simple description of action potential initiation is accurate it does not explain phenomena such as excitation block (the ability to prevent neurons from eliciting action potentials by stimulating them with large current steps) and the ability to elicit action potentials by briefly hyperpolarizing the membrane by analyzing the dynamics of a system of sodium and potassium channels in a membrane patch using computational models however these phenomena are readily explained
^ note that these purkinje fibers are muscle fibers and not related to the purkinje cells which are neurons found in the cerebellum
