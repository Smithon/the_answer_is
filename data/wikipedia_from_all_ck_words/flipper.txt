in physics mass is a property of a physical body which determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies its resistance to being accelerated by a force and in the theory of relativity gives the massenergy content of a system the si unit of mass is the kilogram (kg)
mass is not the same as weight even though we often calculate an object's mass by measuring its weight with a spring scale instead of comparing it to known masses an object on the moon would weigh less than it would on earth because of the lower gravity but it would still have the same mass
for everyday objects and energies well-described by newtonian physics mass describes the amount of matter in an object however at very high speeds or for subatomic particles special relativity shows that energy is an additional source of mass thus any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction
there are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass although some theorists have speculated some of these phenomena could be independent of each other current experiments have found no difference among any of the ways used to measure mass
inertial mass measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a force (represented by the relationship f = ma)
active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an object
passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force experienced by an object in a known gravitational field
massenergy measures the total amount of energy contained within a body using e = mc2
the mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force this phenomenon is called inertia according to newton's second law of motion if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a single force f its acceleration a is given by f/m a body's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field if a first body of mass ma is placed at a distance r (center of mass to center of mass) from a second body of mass mb each body experiences an attractive force fg = gmamb/r2 where g = 69896670000000000006.671011 n kg2 m2 is the universal gravitational constant this is sometimes referred to as gravitational mass repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical since 1915 this observation has been entailed a priori in the equivalence principle of general relativity
== units of massedit ==
the standard international system of units (si) unit of mass is the kilogram (kg) the kilogram is 1000 grams (g) first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the melting point of ice then in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram and as such is independent of the meter or the properties of water as of january 2013 there are several proposals for redefining the kilogram yet again including a proposal for defining it in terms of the planck constant
other units are accepted for use in si
the tonne (t) (or metric ton") is equal to 1000 kg
the electronvolt (ev) is a unit of energy but because of the massenergy equivalence it can easily be converted to a unit of mass and is often used like one in this context the mass has units of ev/c2 the electronvolt is common in particle physics
the atomic mass unit (u) is 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom approximately 69731660000000000001.661027 kg the atomic mass unit is convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules
outside the si system other units include
the slug (sl) is an imperial unit of mass (about 14.6 kg) similar to the kilogram
the pound (lb) is a unit of both mass and force used mainly in the united states (about 0.45 kg or 4.5 n) in scientific contexts where pound (force) and pound (mass) need to be distinguished si units are usually used instead
the planck mass (mp) is the maximum mass of point particles (about 69922180000000000002.18108 kg) it is used in particle physics
the solar mass (m) is defined as the mass of the sun it is primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or galaxies (70301990000000000001.991030 kg)
the mass of a very small particle may be identified with its inverse compton wavelength (1 cm1 69593520000000000003.521041 kg)
the mass of a very large star or black hole may be identified with its schwarzschild radius (1 cm 70246730000000000006.731024 kg)
== definitions of massedit ==
in physical science one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of mass or seven physical notions that involve the concept of mass every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be proportional and in some cases equal and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass
the amount of matter in certain types of samples can be exactly determined through electrodeposition or other precise processes the mass of an exact sample is determined in part by the number and type of atoms or molecules it contains and in part by the energy involved in binding it together (which contributes a negative missing mass, or mass deficit)
inertial mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changing its state of motion when a force is applied it is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force an object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force one says the body of greater mass has greater inertia
active gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's gravitational flux (gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface) gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small test object to freely fall and measuring its free-fall acceleration for example an object in free-fall near the moon will experience less gravitational field and hence accelerate more slowly than the same object would if it were in free-fall near the earth the gravitational field near the moon is weaker because the moon has less active gravitational mass
passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's interaction with a gravitational field passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object's weight by its free-fall acceleration two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration however the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force (less weight) than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass
energy also has mass according to the principle of massenergy equivalence this equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including pair production nuclear fusion and the gravitational bending of light pair production and nuclear fusion are processes through which measurable amounts of mass and energy are converted into each other in the gravitational bending of light photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass
curvature of spacetime is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure for this reason curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by einstein's theory of general relativity extremely precise atomic clocks on the surface of the earth for example are found to measure less time (run slower) when compared to similar clocks in space this difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called gravitational time dilation other forms of curvature have been measured using the gravity probe b satellite
quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object's quantum frequency and its wave number the quantum mass of an electron the compton wavelength can be determined through various forms of spectroscopy and is closely related to the rydberg constant the bohr radius and the classical electron radius the quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a watt balance in relativistic quantum mechanics mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the poincar group
=== weight vs massedit ===
in everyday usage mass and weight are often used interchangeably for instance a person's weight may be stated as 75 kg in a constant gravitational field the weight of an object is proportional to its mass and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts but because of slight differences in the strength of the earth's gravitational field at different places the distinction becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent and for places far from the surface of the earth such as in space or on other planets conceptually mass (measured in kilograms) refers to an intrinsic property of an object whereas weight (measured in newtons) measures an object's resistance to deviating from its natural course of free fall which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field no matter how strong the gravitational field objects in free fall are weightless though they still have mass
the force known as weight is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall for example when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall) it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the earth or the moon this force keeps the object from going into free fall weight is the opposing force in such circumstances and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall on the surface of the earth for example an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall by contrast on the surface of the moon the same object still has a mass of 50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon restated in mathematical terms on the surface of the earth the weight w of an object is related to its mass m by w = mg where g = 70009806650000000009.80665 m/s2 is the acceleration due to earth's gravitational field (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object)
for other situations such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall which is called the proper acceleration through such mechanisms objects in elevators vehicles centrifuges and the like may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects resulting from planetary surfaces in such cases the generalized equation for weight w of an object is related to its mass m by the equation w = ma where a is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity (again if gravity is the only influence such as occurs when an object falls freely its weight will be zero)
macroscopically mass is associated with matter although matter is not ultimately as clearly defined a concept as mass on the subatomic scale not only fermions the particles often associated with matter but also some bosons the particles that act as force carriers have rest mass another problem for easy definition is that much of the rest mass of ordinary matter derives from the invariant mass contributed to matter by particles and kinetic energies which have no rest mass themselves (only 1% of the rest mass of matter is accounted for by the rest mass of its fermionic quarks and electrons) from a fundamental physics perspective mass is the number describing under which the representation of the little group of the poincar group a particle transforms in the standard model of particle physics this symmetry is described as arising as a consequence of a coupling of particles with rest mass to a postulated additional field known as the higgs field
the total mass of the observable universe is estimated at between 1052 kg and 1053 kg corresponding to the rest mass of between 1079 and 1080 protons
=== inertial vs gravitational massedit ===
although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them in classical mechanics newton's third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical (or at least proportional) but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass that it does is merely an empirical fact
albert einstein developed his general theory of relativity starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and (passive) gravitational mass is not accidental that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them (the weak version of the equivalence principle) however in the resulting theory gravitation is not a force and thus not subject to newton's third law so the equality of inertial and active gravitational mass [...] remains as puzzling as ever
the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the galilean equivalence principle or the weak equivalence principle the most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses m and m respectively if the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field g combining newton's second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration
this says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant k if and only if all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field this phenomenon is referred to as the universality of free-fall (in addition the constant k can be taken to be 1 by defining our units appropriately.)
the first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were conducted by galileo it is commonly stated that galileo obtained his results by dropping objects from the leaning tower of pisa but this is most likely apocryphal actually he performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless inclined planes to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy increasingly precise experiments have been performed such as those performed by lornd etvs using the torsion balance pendulum in 1889 as of 2008 no deviation from universality and thus from galilean equivalence has ever been found at least to the precision 1012 more precise experimental efforts are still being carried out
the universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force all other forces especially friction and air resistance must be absent or at least negligible for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on earth the feather will take much longer to reach the ground the feather is not really in free-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a vacuum in which there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other and of the ground towards both objects for its own part is negligible) this can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump it is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum as david scott did on the surface of the moon during apollo 15
a stronger version of the equivalence principle known as the einstein equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle lies at the heart of the general theory of relativity einstein's equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field thus the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object's tendency to move in a straight line (in other words its inertia) and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field
=== origin of massedit ===
in theoretical physics a mass generation mechanism is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics to date a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views at the origin of mass the problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational interaction but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of particle physics known as the standard model

=== weight as an amountedit ===
the concept of amount is very old and predates recorded history humans at some early era realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was directly proportional to the number of objects in the collection
where w is the weight of the collection of similar objects and n is the number of objects in the collection proportionality by definition implies that two values have a constant ratio
 or equivalently
an early use of this relationship is a balance scale which balances the force of one object's weight against the force of another object's weight the two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields hence if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar this allows the scale by comparing weights to also compare masses
consequently historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts the romans for example used the carob seed (carat or siliqua) as a measurement standard if an object's weight was equivalent to 1728 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman pound if on the other hand the object's weight was equivalent to 144 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman ounce (uncia) the roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard the carob seed the ratio of a roman ounce (144 carob seeds) to a roman pound (1728 carob seeds) was
=== planetary motionedit ===
in 1600 ad johannes kepler sought employment with tycho brahe who had some of the most precise astronomical data available using brahe's precise observations of the planet mars kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion in 1609 johannes kepler published his three laws of planetary motion explaining how the planets orbit the sun in kepler's final planetary model he described planetary orbits as following elliptical paths with the sun at a focal point of the ellipse kepler discovered that the square of the orbital period of each planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit or equivalently that the ratio of these two values is constant for all planets in the solar system
on 25 august 1609 galileo galilei demonstrated his first telescope to a group of venetian merchants and in early january of 1610 galileo observed four dim objects near jupiter which he mistook for stars however after a few days of observation galileo realized that these stars were in fact orbiting jupiter these four objects (later named the galilean moons in honor of their discoverer) were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the earth or sun galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods
=== galilean free falledit ===
sometime prior to 1638 galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall attempting to characterize these motions galileo was not the first to investigate earth's gravitational field nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics however galileo's reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists it is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept or if they were real experiments performed by galileo but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling a biography by galileo's pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass in support of this conclusion galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument he asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body the only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate
a later experiment was described in galileo's two new sciences published in 1638 one of galileo's fictional characters salviati describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp the wooden ramp was 12 cubits long half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick with a straight smooth polished groove the groove was lined with parchment also smooth and polished as possible and into this groove was placed a hard smooth and very round bronze ball the ramp was inclined at various angles to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured the ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured the time was measured using a water clock described as follows
a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length the water thus collected was weighed after each descent on a very accurate balance the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many many times there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.
galileo found that for an object in free fall the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time
galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the earths gravitational field have a constant acceleration and galileos contemporary johannes kepler had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the suns gravitational mass however galileos free fall motions and keplers planetary motions remained distinct during galileos lifetime
== newtonian massedit ==
robert hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674 stating that all celestial bodies have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity he further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center in correspondence with isaac newton from 1679 and 1680 hooke conjectures that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies hooke urged newton who was a pioneer in the development of calculus to work through the mathematical details of keplerian orbits to determine if hooke's hypothesis was correct newton's own investigations verified that hooke was correct but due to personal differences between the two men newton chose not to reveal this to hooke isaac newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684 at which time he told a friend edmond halley that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits but had misplaced the solution in his office after being encouraged by halley newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings in november 1684 isaac newton sent a document to edmund halley now lost but presumed to have been titled de motu corporum in gyrum (latin for on the motion of bodies in an orbit") halley presented newton's findings to the royal society of london with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set entitled philosophi naturalis principia mathematica (latin mathematical principles of natural philosophy") the first was received by the royal society on 28 april 16856 the second on 2 march 16867 and the third on 6 april 16867 the royal society published newtons entire collection at their own expense in may 16867
isaac newton had bridged the gap between keplers gravitational mass and galileos gravitational acceleration resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these
where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist is the gravitational mass (standard gravitational parameter) of the body causing gravitational fields and r is the radial coordinate (the distance between the centers of the two bodies)
by finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass the mass of the earth can be determined using kepler's method (from the orbit of earth's moon) or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earth's surface and multiplying that by the square of the earth's radius the mass of the earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the sun to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered
=== newton's cannonballedit ===
newton's cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between galileo's gravitational acceleration and kepler's elliptical orbits it appeared in newton's 1728 book a treatise of the system of the world according to galileo's concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to earth's gravity) it follows a curved path for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the earth. newton further reasons that if an object were projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain with sufficient velocity it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projected.
=== universal gravitational massedit ===
in contrast to earlier theories (e.g celestial spheres) which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center
for example according to newton's theory of universal gravitation each carob seed produces a gravitational field therefore if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere hence it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the earth or sun in fact by unit conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass
measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle but extremely difficult in practice according to newton's theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere however from a practical standpoint the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure newton's books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s but the first successful measurement of the earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units the cavendish experiment did not occur until 1797 over a hundred years later cavendish found that the earth's density was 5.448 0.033 times that of water as of 2009 the earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures
given two objects a and b of masses ma and mb separated by a displacement rab newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other of magnitude
where g is the universal gravitational constant the above statement may be reformulated in the following way if g is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass m is
this is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing in simple spring scales for example the force f is proportional to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan as per hooke's law and the scales are calibrated to take g into account allowing the mass m to be read off assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance a balance measures relative weight giving the relative gravitation mass of each object
=== inertial massedit ===
inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration the simple classical mechanics definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of special relativity but the essential meaning is the same
in classical mechanics according to newton's second law we say that a body has a mass m if at any instant of time it obeys the equation of motion
where f is the resultant force acting on the body and a is the acceleration of the body's centre of mass for the moment we will put aside the question of what force acting on the body actually means
this equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body consider two objects with different masses if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater resistance to changing its state of motion in response to the force
however this notion of applying identical forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of newton's third law which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force to be precise suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses m1 and m2 we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2 which we denote f12 and the force exerted on m2 by m1 which we denote f21 newton's second law states that
where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2 respectively suppose that these accelerations are non-zero so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero this occurs for example if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another newton's third law then states that
and thus
if |a1| is non-zero the fraction is well-defined which allows us to measure the inertial mass of m1 in this case m2 is our reference object and we can define its mass m as (say) 1 kilogram then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations
additionally mass relates a body's momentum p to its linear velocity v
and the body's kinetic energy k to its velocity
== atomic massedit ==
typically the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram which is defined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram (ipk) a platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in a vault at the international bureau of weights and measures in france however the ipk is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of similar scale as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms and has most certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to prevent this it is much easier to precisely compare an atom's mass to that of another atom thus scientists developed the atomic mass unit by definition 1 u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and by extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 u
== mass in relativityedit ==
=== special relativityedit ===
in special relativity there are two kinds of mass rest mass (invariant mass) and relativistic mass (which increases with velocity) rest mass is the newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by c2 the two are related by the following equation
where is the lorentz factor
the invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's frame of reference in order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers it is convenient to use rest mass the rest mass of a body is also related to its energy e and the magnitude of its momentum p by the relativistic energy-momentum equation
so long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference the conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others particles of matter may be converted to types of energy (e.g light kinetic energy the potential energy in magnetic electric and other fields) but this does not affect the amount of mass although things like heat may not be matter all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass thus mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity rather both are names for the same thing and neither mass nor energy appear without the other
both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship e = mc2 yielding rest energy and relativistic energy (total system energy) respectively
the relativistic mass and energy concepts are related to their rest counterparts but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum because the relativistic mass is proportional to the energy it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists there is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful pedagogically
in bound systems the binding energy must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound mass is not conserved in this process because the system is not closed during the binding process for example the binding energy of atomic nuclei is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles (nucleons) of which they are composed
=== general relativityedit ===
in general relativity the equivalence principle is any of several related concepts dealing with the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass at the core of this assertion is albert einstein's idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the earth) is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial (i.e accelerated) frame of reference
however it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of invariant mass in general relativity at the core of the problem is the non-linearity of the einstein field equations making it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the stressenergy tensor in a way that is invariant for all observers for a given observer this can be achieved by the stressenergymomentum pseudotensor
== mass in quantum physicsedit ==
in classical mechanics the inert mass of a particle appears in the eulerlagrange equation as a parameter m
after quantization replacing the position vector x with a wave function the parameter m appears in the kinetic energy operator
in the ostensibly covariant (relativistically invariant) dirac equation and in natural units this becomes
where the mass parameter m is now simply a constant associated with the quantum described by the wave function 
in the standard model of particle physics as developed in the 1960s there is the proposal that this term arises from the coupling of the field to an additional field  the so-called higgs field in the case of fermions the higgs mechanism results in the replacement of the term m in the lagrangian with  this shifts the explanandum of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown couplings g the tentatively confirmed discovery of a massive higgs boson is regarded as a strong confirmation of this theory but there is indirect evidence for the reality of the electroweak symmetry breaking as described by the higgs mechanism and the non-existence of higgs bosons would indicate a higgsless description of this mechanism
=== tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) massedit ===
a tachyonic field or simply tachyon is a quantum field with an imaginary mass although tachyons (particles that move faster than light) are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics and are discussed in popular books on physics under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality) while the field may have imaginary mass any physical particles do not the imaginary mass shows that the system becomes unstable and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation (closely related to second order phase transitions) that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics
the term tachyon was coined by gerald feinberg in a 1967 paper but it was soon realized that feinberg's model in fact did not allow for superluminal speeds instead the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons this process is known as tachyon condensation well known examples include the condensation of the higgs boson in particle physics and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics
although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the scalar field is even for tachyonic quantum fields the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute (or anticommute) thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light and solutions grow exponentially but not superluminally (there is no violation of causality) tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared
this is a special case of the general rule where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass with the real part being their mass in usual sense and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units however in quantum field theory a particle (a one-particle state") is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time i.e. an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian an unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time if it exists long enough to be measured it can be formally described as having a complex mass with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part if both parts are of the same magnitude this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than particle as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process in the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it
in a lorentz invariant theory the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called bradyons in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons in particular the energymomentum relation
(where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass) should still apply along with the formula for the total energy of a particle
this equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the rest massenergy") and a contribution from its motion the kinetic energy when v is larger than c the denominator in the equation for the energy is imaginary as the value under the radical is negative because the total energy must be real the numerator must also be imaginary i.e the rest mass m must be imaginary as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number
