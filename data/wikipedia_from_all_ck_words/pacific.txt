the pacific ocean is the largest of the earth's oceanic divisions it extends from the arctic ocean in the north to the southern ocean (or depending on definition to antarctica) in the south and is bounded by asia and australia in the west and the americas in the east
at 165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles) in area this largest division of the world oceanand in turn the hydrospherecovers about 46% of the earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area making it larger than all of the earth's land area combined the equator subdivides it into the north pacific ocean and south pacific ocean with two exceptions the galpagos and gilbert islands while straddling the equator are deemed wholly within the south pacific the mariana trench in the western north pacific is the deepest point in the world reaching a depth of 10,911 metres (35,797 ft)
the eastern pacific ocean was first sighted by europeans in the early 16th century when spanish explorer vasco nez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama in 1513 and discovered the great southern sea which he named mar del sur the ocean's current name was coined by portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan during the spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521 as he encountered favourable winds on reaching the ocean he called it mar pacifico which in both portuguese and spanish means peaceful sea
== history ==
=== early migrations ===
important human migrations occurred in the pacific in prehistoric times about 3000 bc the austronesian peoples on the island of taiwan mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves and their languages south to the philippines indonesia and maritime southeast asia west towards madagascar southeast towards new guinea and melanesia (intermarrying with native papuans) and east to the islands of micronesia oceania and polynesia
long-distance trade developed all along the coast from mozambique to japan trade and therefore knowledge extended to the indonesian islands but apparently not australia by at least 878 when there was a significant islamic settlement in canton much of this trade was controlled by arabs or muslims in 219 bc xu fu sailed out into the pacific searching for the elixir of immortality from 1404 to 1433 zheng he led expeditions into the indian ocean
=== european exploration ===
the first contact of european navigators with the western edge of the pacific ocean was made by the portuguese expeditions of antnio de abreu and francisco serro to the maluku islands in 1512 and with jorge lvares's expedition to southern china in 1513 both ordered by afonso de albuquerque
the east side of the ocean was discovered by spanish explorer vasco nez de balboa in 1513 after his expedition crossed the isthmus of panama and reached a new ocean he named it mar del sur (literally sea of the south or south sea") because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the pacific
later portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan sailed the pacific on a spanish expedition of world circumnavigation starting in 1519 magellan called the ocean pacfico (or pacific meaning peaceful") because after sailing through the stormy seas off cape horn the expedition found calm waters the ocean was often called the sea of magellan in his honor until the eighteenth century although magellan himself died in the philippines in 1521 spanish navigator juan sebastin elcano led the expedition back to spain across the indian ocean and round the cape of good hope completing the first world circumnavigation in 1522 sailing around and east of the moluccas between 1525 and 1527 portuguese expeditions discovered the caroline islands and papua new guinea in 154243 the portuguese also reached japan
in 1564 five spanish ships consisting of 379 explorers crossed the ocean from mexico led by miguel lpez de legazpi and sailed to the philippines and mariana islands for the remainder of the 16th century spanish influence was paramount with ships sailing from mexico and peru across the pacific ocean to the philippines via guam and establishing the spanish east indies the manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries linking manila and acapulco in one of the longest trade routes in history spanish expeditions also discovered tuvalu the marquesas the cook islands the solomon islands and the admiralty islands in the south pacific
later in the quest for terra australis (i.e. the [great] southern land") spanish explorers in the 17th century discovered the pitcairn and vanuatu archipelagos and sailed the torres strait between australia and new guinea named after navigator lus vaz de torres dutch explorers sailing around southern africa also engaged in discovery and trade abel janszoon tasman discovered tasmania and new zealand in 1642
in the 16th and 17th century spain considered the pacific ocean a mare clausuma sea closed to other naval powers as the only known entrance from the atlantic the strait of magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-spanish ships on the western end of the pacific ocean the dutch threatened the spanish philippines
the 18th century marked the beginning of major exploration by the russians in alaska and the aleutian islands spain also sent expeditions to the pacific northwest reaching vancouver island in southern canada and alaska the french explored and settled polynesia and the british made three voyages with james cook to the south pacific and australia hawaii and the north american pacific northwest in 1768 pierre-antoine vron a young astronomer accompanying louis antoine de bougainville on his voyage of exploration established the width of the pacific with precision for the first time in history one of the earliest voyages of scientific exploration was organized by spain in the malaspina expedition of 17891794 it sailed vast areas of the pacific from cape horn to alaska guam and the philippines new zealand australia and the south pacific
=== new imperialism ===
growing imperialism during the 19th century resulted in the occupation of much of oceania by other european powers and later japan and the united states significant contributions to oceanographic knowledge were made by the voyages of hms beagle in the 1830s with charles darwin aboard hms challenger during the 1870s the uss tuscarora (187376) and the german gazelle (187476)
in oceania france got a leading position as imperial power after making tahiti and new caledonia protectorates in 1842 and 1853 respectively after navy visits to easter island in 1875 and 1887 chilean navy officer policarpo toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into chile with native rapanui in 1888 by occupying easter island chile joined the imperial nations by 1900 nearly all pacific islands were in control of britain france united states germany japan and chile
although the united states gained control of guam and the philippines from spain in 1898 japan controlled most of the western pacific by 1914 and occupied many other islands during world war ii however by the end of that war japan was defeated and the u.s pacific fleet was the virtual master of the ocean since the end of world war ii many former colonies in the pacific have become independent states
== geography ==
the pacific separates asia and australia from the americas it may be further subdivided by the equator into northern (north pacific) and southern (south pacific) portions it extends from the antarctic region in the south to the arctic in the north the pacific ocean encompasses approximately one-third of the earth's surface having an area of 165.2 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles)significantly larger than earth's entire landmass of some 150 million square kilometers (58 million square miles)
extending approximately 15,500 km (9,600 mi) from the bering sea in the arctic to the northern extent of the circumpolar southern ocean at 60s (older definitions extend it to antarctica's ross sea) the pacific reaches its greatest east-west width at about 5n latitude where it stretches approximately 19,800 km (12,300 mi) from indonesia to the coast of colombiahalfway around the world and more than five times the diameter of the moon the lowest known point on earththe mariana trenchlies 10,911 m (35,797 ft 5,966 fathoms) below sea level its average depth is 4,280 m (14,040 ft 2,340 fathoms) putting the total water volume at 710,000,000 cubic kilometers
due to the effects of plate tectonics the pacific ocean is currently shrinking by roughly one inch (2.5 cm) per year on three sides roughly averaging 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) a year by contrast the atlantic ocean is increasing in size
along the pacific ocean's irregular western margins lie many seas the largest of which are the celebes sea coral sea east china sea philippine sea sea of japan south china sea sulu sea tasman sea and yellow sea the strait of malacca joins the pacific and the indian oceans on the west and drake passage and the strait of magellan link the pacific with the atlantic ocean on the east to the north the bering strait connects the pacific with the arctic ocean
as the pacific straddles the 180th meridian the west pacific (or western pacific near asia) is in the eastern hemisphere while the east pacific (or eastern pacific near the americas) is in the western hemisphere
for most of magellan's voyage from the strait of magellan to the philippines the explorer indeed found the ocean peaceful however the pacific is not always peaceful many tropical storms batter the islands of the pacific the lands around the pacific rim are full of volcanoes and often affected by earthquakes tsunamis caused by underwater earthquakes have devastated many islands and in some cases destroyed entire towns
the martin waldseemller map of 1507 was the first to show the americas separating two distinct oceans later the diogo ribeiro map of 1529 was the first to show the pacific at about its proper size
=== bordering countries and territories ===

=== landmasses and islands ===
the islands entirely within the pacific ocean can be divided into three main groups known as micronesia melanesia and polynesia micronesia which lies north of the equator and west of the international date line includes the mariana islands in the northwest the caroline islands in the center the marshall islands to the west and the islands of kiribati in the southwest
melanesia to the southwest includes new guinea the world's second largest island after greenland and by far the largest of the pacific islands the other main melanesian groups from north to south are the bismarck archipelago the solomon islands santa cruz vanuatu fiji and new caledonia
the largest area polynesia stretching from hawaii in the north to new zealand in the south also encompasses tuvalu tokelau samoa tonga and the kermadec islands to the west the cook islands society islands and austral islands in the center and the marquesas islands tuamotu mangareva islands and easter island to the east
islands in the pacific ocean are of four basic types continental islands high islands coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include new guinea the islands of new zealand and the philippines some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents high islands are of volcanic origin and many contain active volcanoes among these are bougainville hawaii and the solomon islands
the coral reefs of the south pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface one of the most dramatic is the great barrier reef off northeastern australia with chains of reef patches a second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands examples include banaba (formerly ocean island) and makatea in the tuamotu group of french polynesia
== water characteristics ==
the volume of the pacific ocean representing about 50.1 percent of the world's oceanic water has been estimated at some 714 million cubic kilometers surface water temperatures in the pacific can vary from 1.4 c (29.5 f) the freezing point of sea water in the poleward areas to about 30 c (86 f) near the equator salinity also varies latitudinally reaching a maximum of 37 parts per thousand in the southeastern area the water near the equator which can have a salinity as low as 34 parts per thousand is less salty than that found in the mid-latitudes because of abundant equatorial precipitation throughout the year the lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas the motion of pacific waters is generally clockwise in the northern hemisphere (the north pacific gyre) and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere the north equatorial current driven westward along latitude 15n by the trade winds turns north near the philippines to become the warm japan or kuroshio current
turning eastward at about 45n the kuroshio forks and some water moves northward as the aleutian current while the rest turns southward to rejoin the north equatorial current the aleutian current branches as it approaches north america and forms the base of a counter-clockwise circulation in the bering sea its southern arm becomes the chilled slow south-flowing california current the south equatorial current flowing west along the equator swings southward east of new guinea turns east at about 50s and joins the main westerly circulation of the south pacific which includes the earth-circling antarctic circumpolar current as it approaches the chilean coast the south equatorial current divides one branch flows around cape horn and the other turns north to form the peru or humboldt current
== climate ==
the climate patterns of the northern and southern hemispheres generally mirror each other the trade winds in the southern and eastern pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the north pacific are far more varied with for example cold winter temperatures on the east coast of russia contrasting with the milder weather off british columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents
in the tropical and subtropical pacific the el nio southern oscillation (enso) affects weather conditions to determine the phase of enso the most recent three-month sea surface temperature average for the area approximately 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) to the southeast of hawaii is computed and if the region is more than 0.5 c (0.9 f) above or below normal for that period then an el nio or la nia is considered in progress
in the tropical western pacific the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the asian landmass worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active month november is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active cyclones are liable to form south of mexico striking the western mexican coast and occasionally the southwestern united states between june and october with those forming in the western pacific moving into southeast and east asia from may to december
in the arctic icing from october to may can present a hazard for shipping while persistent fog occurs from june to december a climatological low in the gulf of alaska keeps the southern coast wet and mild during the winter months the westerlies and associated jet stream within the mid-latitudes can be particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere due to the temperature difference between the tropics and antarctica which records the coldest temperature readings on the planet in the southern hemisphere because of the stormy and cloudy conditions associated with extratropical cyclones riding the jet stream it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude
== geology ==
the ocean was first mapped by abraham ortelius he called it maris pacifici following ferdinand magellan's description of it as a pacific sea during his circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522 to magellan it seemed much more calm (pacific) than the atlantic
the andesite line is the most significant regional distinction in the pacific a petrologic boundary it separates the deeper mafic igneous rock of the central pacific basin from the partially submerged continental areas of felsic igneous rock on its margins the andesite line follows the western edge of the islands off california and passes south of the aleutian arc along the eastern edge of the kamchatka peninsula the kuril islands japan the mariana islands the solomon islands and new zealand's north island
the dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the andes cordillera along south america to mexico returning then to the islands off california indonesia the philippines japan new guinea and new zealand lie outside the andesite line
within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs submerged volcanic mountains and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the pacific basin here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs chains and clusters outside the andesite line volcanism is of the explosive type and the pacific ring of fire is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism the ring of fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones
the pacific ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones only the antarctic and australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones
=== geological history ===
the pacific ocean was born 750 million years ago at the breakup of rodinia although it is generally called the panthalassic ocean until the breakup of pangea about 200 million years ago the oldest pacific ocean floor is only around 180 ma old with older crust subducted by now
=== seamount chains ===
the pacific ocean contains several long seamount chains formed by hotspot volcanism these include the hawaiianemperor seamount chain and the louisville seamount chain
== economy ==
the exploitation of the pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths in shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of australia and new zealand petroleum and natural gas are extracted and pearls are harvested along the coasts of australia japan papua new guinea nicaragua panama and the philippines although in sharply declining volume in some cases
=== fishing ===
fish are an important economic asset in the pacific the shallower shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield herring salmon sardines snapper swordfish and tuna as well as shellfish overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas for example catches in the rich fishing grounds of the okhotsk sea off the russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing
== environmental issues ==
the quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east pacific ocean has increased a hundredfold over the past 40 years (2012)
marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste the rivers then empty into the ocean often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone
marine debris also known as marine litter is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake sea ocean or waterway oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter
in addition the pacific ocean has served as the crash site of satellites including mars 96 fobos-grunt and upper atmosphere research satellite
