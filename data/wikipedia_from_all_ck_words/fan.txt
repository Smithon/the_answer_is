green is the color between blue and yellow on the spectrum of visible light it is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 495570 nm in the subtractive color system used in painting and color printing it is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors
the modern english word green comes from the middle english and anglo-saxon word grene from the same germanic root as the words grass and grow it is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime growth and nature by far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage several minerals have a green color including the emerald which is colored green by its chromium content
in surveys made in europe and the united states green is the color most commonly associated with nature youth spring hope and envy in europe and the u.s green is sometimes associated with death sickness or the devil but in china its associations are very positive as the symbol of fertility because of its association with youth it is sometimes used to describe someone who is inexperienced in the middle ages and renaissance when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status green was worn by merchants bankers and the gentry while red was the color of the nobility the mona lisa by leonardo da vinci wears green showing she is not from a noble family the benches in the british house of commons are green while those in the house of lords are red green is also the traditional color of safety and permission a green light means go ahead a green card permits permanent residence in the united states it is the most important color in islam it was the color of the banner of muhammad and is found in the flags of nearly all islamic countries and represents the lush vegetation of paradise it is also often associated with the culture of gaelic ireland and is a color of the flag of ireland because of its association with nature it is the color of the environmental movement political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the green movement some naming themselves green parties this has led to similar campaigns in advertising as companies have sold green or environmentally friendly products
== etymology and linguistic definitions ==
the word green comes from the middle english and old english word grene which like the german word grn has the same root as the words grass and grow it is from a common germanic *gronja- which is also reflected in old norse grnn old high german gruoni (but unattested in east germanic) ultimately from a pie root *ghre- to grow and root-cognate with grass and to grow the first recorded use of the word as a color term in old english dates to ca ad 700
latin with viridis also has a genuine and widely used term for green related to virere to grow and ver spring it gave rise to words in several romance languages french vert italian verde (and english vert verdure etc.) likewise the slavic languages with zelen ancient greek also had a term for yellowish pale green  chloros (cf the color of chlorine) cognate with verdant and the green of new growth
thus the languages mentioned above (germanic romance slavic greek) have old terms for green which are derived from words for fresh sprouting vegetation however comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently over the past few millennia and there is no identifiable single proto-indo-european or word for green for example the slavic zelen is cognate with sanskrit hari yellow ochre golden the turkic languages also have jal green or yellowish green compared to a mongolian word for meadow
=== languages where green and blue are one color ===
in some languages including old chinese thai old japanese and vietnamese the same word can mean either blue or green the chinese character (pronounced qng in mandarin ao in japanese and thanh in sino-vietnamese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green blue and green are traditionally considered shades of  in more contemporary terms they are (ln in mandarin) and (l in mandarin) respectively japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green (midori which is derived from the classical japanese descriptive verb midoru to be in leaf to flourish in reference to trees) and (guriin which is derived from the english word green") however in japan although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have the green light is described using the same word as for blue aoi because green is considered a shade of aoi similarly green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples green shiso (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word aoi vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green xanh with variants such as xanh da tri (azure lit sky blue") lam (blue) and lc (green also xanh l cy lit leaf green")
green in modern european languages corresponds to about 520570 nm but many historical and non-european languages make other choices e.g using a term for the range of ca 450530 nm ("blue/green") and another for ca 530590 nm ("green/yellow") in the comparative study of color terms in the world's languages green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white black red green yellow and blue) or more rarely in systems with five colors (white red yellow green and black/blue) (see distinction of green from blue) these languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote green but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the english adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit) thus the thai word besides meaning green also means rank and smelly and holds other unpleasant associations
the celtic languages had a term for blue/green/grey proto-celtic *glasto- which gave rise to old irish glas green grey and to welsh glas blue this word is cognate with the ancient greek bluish green contrasting with yellowish green discussed above
in modern japanese the term for green is  while the old term for blue/green blue ( ao) now means blue but in certain contexts green is still conventionally referred to as  as in blue traffic light ( ao shing) and blue leaves ( aoba) reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old japanese (more accurately the traditional japanese color terminology grouped some shades of green with blue and others with yellow tones)
the persian language is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction the persian word sabz can mean green black or dark thus persian erotic poetry dark-skinned women are addressed as sabz-eh as in phrases like sabz-eh-gandom-gun (literally dark wheat colored") or sabz-eh-malih ("a dark beauty") similarly in sudanese arabic dark-skinned people are described as akhar the term which in standard arabic stands unambiguously for green

=== color vision and colorimetry ===
in optics the perception of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495570 nm the sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507 nm a blue-green color while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555 nm a yellow-green these are the peak locations of the rod and cone (scotopic and photopic respectively) luminosity functions
the perception of greenness (in opposition to redness forming one of the opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength m cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength l cones light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green a green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570 nm
human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells of which there are three types in some cases one is missing or faulty which can cause color blindness including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness green is restful to the eye studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue
in the subtractive color system used in painting and color printing green is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors on the hsv color wheel also known as the rgb color wheel the complement of green is magenta that is a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples) on a traditional color wheel based on subtractive color the complementary color to green is considered to be red
in additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550 nm this green primary is combined with an orangish-red red primary and a purplish-blue blue primary to produce any color in between the rgb color model a unique green (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary
=== lasers ===
lasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm (563.5 thz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness the most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (dpss) technology to create the green light an infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (nd:yvo4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (nd:yag) and induces it to emit 281.76 thz (1064 nm) this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium titanium and phosphorus (ktp) whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 thz) in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm ("green") other green wavelengths are also available using dpss technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers including the heliumneon laser (543 nm) the argon-ion laser (514 nm) and the krypton-ion laser (521 nm and 531 nm) as well as liquid dye lasers green lasers have a wide variety of applications including pointing illumination surgery laser light shows spectroscopy interferometry fluorescence holography machine vision non-lethal weapons and bird control
as of mid-2011 direct green laser diodes at 510 nm and 500 nm have become generally available although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use the efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%) compared to that of dpss green lasers (peak 35%) may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses
=== pigments food coloring and fireworks ===
many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries pigments in this case are minerals which reflect the color green rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities the large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all among the more notable green minerals however is the emerald which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium chromium(iii) oxide (cr2o3) is called chrome green also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment for many years the source of amazonite's color was a mystery widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments chemically known as basic copper(ii) carbonate
verdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper brass or bronze slightly warmed into a vat of fermenting wine leaving it there for several weeks and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal the process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by pliny it was used by the romans in the murals of pompeii and in celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century ad it produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate but it had drawbacks it was unstable it could not resist dampness it did not mix well with other colors it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact. and it was toxic leonardo da vinci in his treatise on painting warned artists not to use it it was widely used in miniature paintings in europe and persia in the 16th and 17th centuries its use largely ended in the late 19th century when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green viridian also called chrome green is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate was patented in 1859 it became popular with painters since unlike other synthetic greens it was stable and not toxic vincent van gogh used it along with prussian blue to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting cafe terrace at night
green earth is a natural pigment used since the time of the roman empire it is composed of clay colored by iron oxide magnesium aluminum silicate or potassium large deposits were found in the south of france near nice and in italy around verona on cyprus and in bohemia the clay was crushed washed to remove impurities then powdered it was sometimes called green of verona
mixtures of oxidized cobalt and zinc were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century
cobalt green sometimes known as rinman's green or zinc green is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt (ii) oxide and zinc oxide sven rinman a swedish chemist discovered this compound in 1780 green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named pannetier in paris in about 1835 emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide it was also known as guignet green

to create green sparks fireworks use barium salts such as barium chlorate barium nitrate crystals or barium chloride also used for green fireplace logs copper salts typically burn blue but cupric chloride (also known as campfire blue") can also produce green flames green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate smoke can be turned green by a mixture solvent yellow 33 solvent green 3 lactose magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate
=== biology ===
green is common in nature as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll which is involved in photosynthesis chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye so light reflected by plants is enriched in green chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin the new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria
animals typically use the color green as camouflage blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment green animals include especially amphibians reptiles and some fish birds and insects most fish reptiles amphibians and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment for example broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds especially invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments sometimes caused by diet this can causes their feces to look green as well other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin the green pigment in bile and ceruloplasmin a protein that carries copper ions in chelation
the green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spider's hemolymph (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids it hunts insects in green vegetation where it is well camouflaged
=== green eyes ===
there is no green pigment in green eyes like the color of blue eyes it is an optical illusion its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin with the blue tone imparted by the rayleigh scattering of the reflected light green eyes are most common in northern and central europe they can also be found in southern europe west asia central asia and south asia in iceland 89% of women and 87% of men have either blue or green eye color a study of icelandic and dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men among european americans green eyes are most common among those of recent celtic and germanic ancestry about 16%

the second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions not just to imitate nature one of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the american artist james mcneil whistler who created a series of paintings called symphonies or noctures of color including symphony in gray and green the ocean between 1866 and 1872
the late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other these studies were avidly followed by artists such as vincent van gogh describing his painting the night cafe to his brother theo in 1888 van gogh wrote i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions the hall is blood red and pale yellow with a green billiard table in the center and four lamps of lemon yellow with rays of orange and green everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.
