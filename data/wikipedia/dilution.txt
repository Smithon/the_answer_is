the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to physical science:
physical science branch of natural science that studies non-living systems in contrast to life science for example biology it in turn has many branches each referred to as a "physical science" together called the "physical sciences" however the term "physical" creates an unintended somewhat arbitrary distinction since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry for example)
== what is physical science?edit ==
physical science can be described as all of the following:
a branch of science systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.a branch of natural science natural science is a major branch of science that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena based on empirical evidence in natural science hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory validity accuracy and social mechanisms ensuring quality control such as peer review and repeatability of findings are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: life science or example biology and physical science each of these branches and all of their sub-branches are referred to as natural sciences

== general principles of the physical sciencesedit ==
principle law or rule that has to be or usually is to be followed or can be desirably followed or is an inevitable consequence of something such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed the principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system or reflecting system's designed purpose and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored
=== basic principles of physicsedit ===
physics branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time along with related concepts such as energy and force physics is one of the "fundamental sciences" because the other natural sciences (like biology geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics according to physics the physical laws of matter energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets molecules atoms or the subatomic particles) some of the basic pursuits of physics which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium include:
describing the nature measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion dynamics etc
newton's laws of motion
mass force and weight
momentum and conservation of energy
gravity theories of gravity
energy work and their relationship
motion position and energy

origins of the universe physical science uses the big bang theory as the commonly accepted scientific theory of the origin of the universe
a heliocentric solar system ancient cultures saw the earth as the centre of the solar system or universe (geocentrism) in the 16th century nicolaus copernicus advanced the ideas of heliocentrism recognizing the sun as the centre of the solar system
the structure of solar systems planets comets asteroids and meteors
the shape and structure of earth (roughly spherical see also spherical earth)
earth in the solar system
time measurement

(note: astronomy should not be confused with astrology which assumes that people's destiny and human affairs in general correlate to the apparent positions of astronomical objects in the sky - although the two fields share a common origin they are quite different; astronomers embrace the scientific method while astrologers do not.)
=== basic principles of chemistryedit ===
