energy conservation refers to reducing energy consumption through using less of an energy service energy conservation differs from efficient energy use which refers to using less energy for a constant service for example driving less is an example of energy conservation driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques
even though energy conservation reduces energy services it can result in increased environmental quality national security personal financial security and higher savings it is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy it also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource depletion
== energy tax ==
some countries which employ energy or carbon taxes to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption carbon taxes can allow consumption to shift to nuclear power and other alternatives that carry a different set of environmental side effects and limitations meanwhile taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production the state of california employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax as usage increases above that baseline the tax is increasing drastically such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers
== building design ==
one of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to use an energy audit an energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output(s) this is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above in addition recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relativily sophisticated energy audits themselves
building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users business and residential to see graphically the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes advanced real-time energy metering is able to help people save energy by their actions
in passive solar building design windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer this is called passive solar design or climatic design because unlike active solar heating systems it doesn't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices
the key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass and shading passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings but existing buildings can be retrofitted
== transportation ==
in the united states suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels which has led to transportation-dependent systems of living zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation the use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy as many americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day
== consumer products ==
consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy efficient products a prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing incandescent light bulbs with more modern alternatives when purchasing light bulbs many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern compact fluorescent and led bulbs although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money the price of leds has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvement of the semiconductor technology many led bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of purchase to the consumer estimates by the u.s department of energy state that widespread adoption of led lighting over the next 20 years could result in about $265 billion worth of savings in united states energy costs
the research one must put into conserving energy is often too time consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using today's fossil fuels some governments and ngos are attempting to reduce this complexity with ecolabels that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping
to provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money time and effort in energy conservation it is important to understand and link to people's topical concerns for instance some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing however health studies have demonstrated that headache stress blood pressure fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings it has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers while reducing energy consumption
== energy conservation by the countries ==
at the end of 2006 the european union (eu) pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20% by 2020 the 'european union energy efficiency action plan' is long awaited directive 2012/27/eu is on energy efficiency
as part of the eu's save programme aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour the boiler efficiency directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels
