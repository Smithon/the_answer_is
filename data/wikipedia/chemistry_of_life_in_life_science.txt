chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition structure properties and change of matter chemistry deals with such topics as the properties of individual atoms how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances
chemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other natural sciences including physics geology and biology for the differences between chemistry and physics see comparison of chemistry and physics
scholars disagree about the etymology of the word chemistry the history of chemistry can be traced to alchemy which had been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world
== etymologyedit ==
the word chemistry comes from the word alchemy an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism and medicine; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold alchemy which was practiced around 330 is the study of the composition of waters movement growth embodying disembodying drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies (zosimos) an alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech and later the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as "chemistry"
the word alchemy in turn is derived from the arabic word al-km () in origin the term is borrowed from the greek or  this may have egyptian origins many believe that al-km is derived from the greek  which is in turn derived from the word chemi or kimi which is the ancient name of egypt in egyptian alternately al-km may derive from  meaning "cast together"
=== definitionedit ===
in retrospect the definition of chemistry has changed over time as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science the term "chymistry" in the view of noted scientist robert boyle in 1661 meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies in 1663 the chemist christopher glaser described "chymistry" as a scientific art by which one learns to dissolve bodies and draw from them the different substances on their composition and how to unite them again and exalt them to a higher perfection
the 1730 definition of the word "chemistry" as used by georg ernst stahl meant the art of resolving mixed compound or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles in 1837 jean-baptiste dumas considered the word "chemistry" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces this definition further evolved until in 1947 it came to mean the science of substances: their structure their properties and the reactions that change them into other substances - a characterization accepted by linus pauling more recently in 1998 professor raymond chang broadened the definition of "chemistry" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes
== historyedit ==
early civilizations such as the egyptians babylonians indians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy pottery and dyes but didn't develop a systematic theory
a basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in classical greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by aristotle stating that that fire air earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination greek atomism dates back to 440 bc arising in works by philosophers such as democritus and epicurus in 50 bc the roman philosopher lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book de rerum natura (on the nature of things) unlike modern concepts of science greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments
in the hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life alchemy was discovered and practised widely throughout the arab world after the muslim conquests and from there diffused into medieval and renaissance europe through latin translations
=== chemistry as scienceedit ===
under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by sir francis bacon and others a group of chemists at oxford robert boyle robert hooke and john mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work the classic chemistry text the sceptical chymist where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry he formulated boyle's law rejected the classical "four elements" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment
the theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the german georg ernst stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the french chemist antoine lavoisier the chemical analogue of newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day
prior to his work though many important discoveries had been made specifically relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases the scottish chemist joseph black (the first experimental chemist) and the dutchman j b van helmont discovered carbon dioxide or what black called 'fixed air' in 1754; henry cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and joseph priestley and independently carl wilhelm scheele isolated pure oxygen
english scientist john dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights
the development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular j j berzelius and humphry davy made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by alessandro volta davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current
british william prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen j a r newlands devised an early table of elements which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements in the 1860s by dmitri mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including julius lothar meyer the inert gases later called the noble gases were discovered by william ramsay in collaboration with lord rayleigh at the end of the century thereby filling in the basic structure of the table
organic chemistry was developed by justus von liebig and others following friedrich whler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were in theory reducible to chemistry other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (edward frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (j w gibbs and svante arrhenius in the 1870s)
=== chemical structureedit ===
at the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms in 1897 j j thomson of cambridge university discovered the electron and soon after the french scientist becquerel as well as the couple pierre and marie curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity in a series of pioneering scattering experiments ernest rutherford at the university of manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles
his work on atomic structure was improved on by his students the danish physicist niels bohr and henry moseley the electronic theory of chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed by the american scientists linus pauling and gilbert n lewis
the year 2011 was declared by the united nations as the international year of chemistry it was an initiative of the international union of pure and applied chemistry and of the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization and involves chemical societies academics and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities
== principles of modern chemistryedit ==
the current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates of matter this matter can be studied in solid liquid or gas states in isolation or in combination the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory
the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware however glassware is not central to chemistry and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it
a chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves atoms as subjects the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal (when the number of atoms on either side is unequal the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules known as chemical laws
energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure phase as well as their chemical compositions they can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis e.g spectroscopy and chromatography scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:
=== matteredit ===
in chemistry matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well - not all particles have rest mass such as the photon matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances
==== atomedit ====
the atom is the basic unit of chemistry it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space called the electron cloud the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons) while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus in a neutral atom the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons the nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is 1,836 times that of an electron yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus
the atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element such as electronegativity ionization potential preferred oxidation state(s) coordination number and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g. metallic ionic covalent)
==== elementedit ====
a chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol z the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes for example all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13
the standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number the periodic table is arranged in groups or columns and periods or rows the periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends
==== compoundedit ====
a compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac) organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system inorganic compounds are named according to the inorganic nomenclature system in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number
==== moleculeedit ====
a molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances however this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules which is not true of many substances (see below) molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs
thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions when this rule is broken giving the "molecule" a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion however the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered "molecules" in chemistry
the "inert" or noble gas elements (helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals
however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt) solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite
one of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure while the structure of diatomic triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial (linear angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature
==== substance and mixtureedit ====
a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties a collection of substances is called a mixture examples of mixtures are air and alloys
==== mole and amount of substanceedit ====
the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount) the mole is defined as the number of atoms found in exactly 0.012 kilogram (or 12 grams) of carbon-12 where the carbon-12 atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically to be approximately 6.0221023 mol1 molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution and is commonly reported in moldm3
=== phaseedit ===
in addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases for the most part the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties a phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties over a range of conditions such as pressure or temperature
physical properties such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase the phase of matter is defined by the phase transition which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system instead of changing the bulk conditions
sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state when three states meet based on the conditions it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions
the most familiar examples of phases are solids liquids and gases many substances exhibit multiple solid phases for example there are three phases of solid iron (alpha gamma and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure a principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure or arrangement of the atoms another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is in water)
less familiar phases include plasmas boseeinstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials while most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology
=== bondingedit ===
atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another a chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them more than simple attraction and repulsion the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom
a chemical bond can be a covalent bond an ionic bond a hydrogen bond or just because of van der waals force each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential these potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals in many simple compounds valence bond theory the valence shell electron pair repulsion model (vsepr) and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition
an ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons becoming a positively charged cation and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom becoming a negatively charged anion the two oppositely charged ions attract one another and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them for example sodium (na) a metal loses one electron to become an na+ cation while chlorine (cl) a non-metal gains this electron to become cl the ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction and that compound sodium chloride (nacl) or common table salt is formed
in a covalent bond one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule however some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium which has two electrons in its outer shell
similarly theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures with more complicated compounds such as metal complexes valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches such as the molecular orbital theory are generally used see diagram on electronic orbitals
=== energyedit ===
in the context of chemistry energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic molecular or aggregate structure since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants
a reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse a reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings
chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy the speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature t) is related to the activation energy e by the boltzmann's population factor - that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius equation the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat light electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound
a related concept free energy which also incorporates entropy considerations is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction in chemical thermodynamics a reaction is feasible only if the total change in the gibbs free energy is negative ; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium
there exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons atoms and molecules these are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics which require quantization of energy of a bound system the atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited the molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is more amenable to chemical reactions
the phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings when the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (h2o); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds whereas hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions
the transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance however heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer thus because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy for example ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy
the existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy e.g ir microwave nmr esr etc spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects - like stars and distant galaxies - by analyzing their radiation spectra
the term chemical energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction or to transform other chemical substances
=== reactionedit ===
when a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy a chemical reaction is said to have occurred a chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the "reaction" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy or both it results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment which may be designed vesselsoften laboratory glassware
chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules that is molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds oxidation reduction dissociation acid-base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions
a chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation while in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz protons and neutrons
the sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps each of which may have a different speed many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions several empirical rules like the woodwardhoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction
according to the iupac gold book a chemical reaction is "a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species." accordingly a chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction an additional caveat is made in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e 'microscopic chemical events')
=== ions and saltsedit ===
an ion is a charged species an atom or a molecule that has lost or gained one or more electrons when an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons the atom is a positively charged ion or cation when an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts such as the na+ and cl ions forming sodium chloride or nacl examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid-base reactions are hydroxide (oh) and phosphate (po43)
plasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized usually through high temperature
=== acidity and basicityedit ===
a substance can often be classified as an acid or a base there are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior the simplest is arrhenius theory which states than an acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water according to brnstedlowry acidbase theory acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion
a third common theory is lewis acid-base theory which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond according to this theory the crucial things being exchanged are charges there are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base as is evident in the history of this concept
acid strength is commonly measured by two methods one measurement based on the arrhenius definition of acidity is ph which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale thus solutions that have a low ph have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic the other measurement based on the brnstedlowry definition is the acid dissociation constant (ka) which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the brnstedlowry definition of an acid that is substances with a higher ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower ka values
=== redoxedit ===
redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation) substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents oxidants or oxidizers an oxidant removes electrons from another substance similarly substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents reductants or reducers
a reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized itself and because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation numberthe actual transfer of electrons may never occur thus oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number
=== equilibriumedit ===
although the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences in the context of chemistry it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible as for example in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase
a system of chemical substances at equilibrium even though having an unchanging composition is most often not static; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time
=== chemical lawsedit ===
chemical reactions are governed by certain laws which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry some of them are:
== practiceedit ==
=== subdisciplinesedit ===
chemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines there are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry
analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry these methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry excluding purely theoretical chemistry
biochemistry is the study of the chemicals chemical reactions and chemical interactions that take place in living organisms biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related as in medicinal chemistry or neurochemistry biochemistry is also associated with molecular biology and genetics
inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds the distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry
materials chemistry is the preparation characterization and understanding of substances with a useful function the field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids liquids polymers) and interfaces between different phases
neurochemistry is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters peptides proteins lipids sugars and nucleic acids; their interactions and the roles they play in forming maintaining and modifying the nervous system
nuclear chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei modern transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field
organic chemistry is the study of the structure properties composition mechanisms and reactions of organic compounds an organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton
physical chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes in particular the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics chemical kinetics electrochemistry statistical mechanics spectroscopy and more recently astrochemistry physical chemistry has large overlap with molecular physics physical chemistry involves the use of infinitesimal calculus in deriving equations it is usually associated with quantum chemistry and theoretical chemistry physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from chemical physics but again there is very strong overlap
theoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics) in particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry since the end of the second world war the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics
other disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study these include inorganic chemistry the study of inorganic matter; organic chemistry the study of organic (carbon-based) matter; biochemistry the study of substances found in biological organisms; physical chemistry the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as thermodynamics and quantum mechanics; and analytical chemistry the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years e.g neurochemistry the chemical study of the nervous system (see subdisciplines)
other fields include agrochemistry astrochemistry (and cosmochemistry) atmospheric chemistry chemical engineering chemical biology chemo-informatics electrochemistry environmental chemistry femtochemistry flavor chemistry flow chemistry geochemistry green chemistry histochemistry history of chemistry hydrogenation chemistry immunochemistry marine chemistry materials science mathematical chemistry mechanochemistry medicinal chemistry molecular biology molecular mechanics nanotechnology natural product chemistry oenology organometallic chemistry petrochemistry pharmacology photochemistry physical organic chemistry phytochemistry polymer chemistry radiochemistry solid-state chemistry sonochemistry supramolecular chemistry surface chemistry synthetic chemistry thermochemistry and many others
