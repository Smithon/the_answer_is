the electric field is a component of the electromagnetic field it is a vector field and is generated by electric charges or time-varying magnetic fields as described by maxwell's equations the concept of an electric field was introduced by michael faraday
== definition ==
the electric field at a given point is defined as the (vectorial) force that would be exerted on a stationary test particle of unit charge by electromagnetic forces (i.e the lorentz force) a particle of charge would be subject to a force 
its si units are newtons per coulomb (nc1) or equivalently volts per metre (vm1) which in terms of si base units are kgms3a1
== sources of electric field ==
=== causes and description ===
electric fields are caused by electric charges or varying magnetic fields the former effect is described by gauss's law the latter by faraday's law of induction which together are enough to define the behavior of the electric field as a function of charge repartition and magnetic field however since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric field the equations of both fields are coupled and together form maxwell's equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents
in the special case of a steady state (stationary charges and currents) the maxwell-faraday inductive effect disappears the resulting two equations (gauss's law and faraday's law with no induction term ) taken together are equivalent to coulomb's law written as for a charge density ( denotes the position in space) notice that  the permittivity of vacuum must be substituted if charges are considered in non-empty media
=== continuous vs discrete charge repartition ===
the equations of electromagnetism are best described in a continuous description however charges are sometimes best described as discrete points; for example some models may describe electrons as punctual sources where charge density is infinite on an infinitesimal section of space
a charge located in can be described mathematically as a charge density  where the dirac delta function (in three dimensions) is used conversely a charge distribution can be approximated by many small punctual charge
== superposition principle ==
electric fields satisfy the superposition principle because maxwell's equations are linear as a result if and are the electric fields resulting from distribution of charges and  a distribution of charges will create an electric field ; for instance coulomb's law is linear in charge density as well
this principle is useful to calculate the field created by multiple point charges if charges are stationary in space at  in the absence of currents the superposition principle proves that the resulting field is the sum of fields generated by each particle as described by coulomb's law:
== electrostatic fields ==
electrostatic fields are e-fields which do not change with time which happens when charges and currents are stationary in that case coulomb's law fully describes the field
=== electric potential ===
by faraday's law the electric field has zero curl one can then define an electric potential that is a function such that  this is analogous to the gravitational potential
=== parallels between electrostatic and gravitational fields ===
coulomb's law which describes the interaction of electric charges:
is similar to newton's law of universal gravitation:
(where )
this suggests similarities between the electric field e and the gravitational field g or their associated potentials mass is sometimes called "gravitational charge" because of that similarity
electrostatic and gravitational forces both are central conservative and obey an inverse-square law
=== uniform fields ===
a uniform field is one in which the electric field is constant at every point it can be approximated by placing two conducting plates parallel to each other and maintaining a voltage (potential difference) between them; it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of the planes electric field is distorted because the plane does not continue) assuming infinite planes the magnitude of the electric field e is:
where is the potential difference between the plates and d is the distance separating the plates the negative sign arises as positive charges repel so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases in micro- and nanoapplications for instance in relation to semiconductors a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of 7006100000000000000106 vm1 achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1 m apart
== electrodynamic fields ==
electrodynamic fields are e-fields which do change with time for instance when charges are in motion
the electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field in that case if a is the magnetic vector potential defined so that  one can still define an electric potential such that:
one can recover faraday's law of induction by taking the curl of that equation
which justifies a posteriori the previous form for e
== energy in the electric field ==
if the magnetic field b is nonzero
the total energy per unit volume stored by the electromagnetic field is
where is the permittivity of the medium in which the field exists its magnetic permeability and e and b are the electric and magnetic field vectors
as e and b fields are coupled it would be misleading to split this expression into "electric" and "magnetic" contributions however in the steady-state case the fields are no longer coupled (see maxwell's equations) it makes sense in that case to compute the electrostatic energy per unit volume:
the total energy u stored in the electric field in a given volume v is therefore
== further extensions ==
=== definitive equation of vector fields ===
in the presence of matter it is helpful in electromagnetism to extend the notion of the electric field into three vector fields rather than just one:
where p is the electric polarization the volume density of electric dipole moments and d is the electric displacement field since e and p are defined separately this equation can be used to define d the physical interpretation of d is not as clear as e (effectively the field applied to the material) or p (induced field due to the dipoles in the material) but still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification since maxwell's equations can be simplified in terms of free charges and currents
=== constitutive relation ===
the e and d fields are related by the permittivity of the material 
for linear homogeneous isotropic materials e and d are proportional and constant throughout the region there is no position dependence: for inhomogeneous materials there is a position dependence throughout the material:
for anisotropic materials the e and d fields are not parallel and so e and d are related by the permittivity tensor (a 2nd order tensor field) in component form:
for non-linear media e and d are not proportional materials can have varying extents of linearity homogeneity and isotropy
