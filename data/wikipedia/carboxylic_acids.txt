a carboxylic acid /krbkslk/ is an organic compound that contains a carboxyl group (c(o)oh) the general formula of a carboxylic acid is rc(o)oh with r referring to the rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule carboxylic acids occur widely and include the amino acids and acetic acid (as vinegar)
salts and esters of carboxylic acids are called carboxylates when a carboxyl group is deprotonated its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than alcohols carboxylic acids can be seen as reduced or alkylated forms of the lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they can be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide
== example carboxylic acids and nomenclatureedit ==
carboxylic acids are commonly named as indicated in the table below although rarely used iupac-recommended names also exist for example butyric acid (c3h7co2h) is according to iupac guidelines also known as butanoic acid
to more easily understand much of the below discussion of reactions involving carboxylic acids it can be helpful to notice that the carboxyl group itself is a "hydroxylated carbonyl group" meaning that two of the carbon atom's four bonds are to an oxygen atom the carbon atom's third bond is to a second oxygen atom (whose other bond is to a hydrogen atom) and the carbon atom's fourth bond attaches to r [a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom is a carbonyl group and two of the carbon atom's bonds remain available for bonding a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom is a hydroxyl group with the oxygen atom's second bond available for bonding.]
the carboxylate anion r-coo is usually named with the suffix ate so acetic acid for example becomes acetate ion in iupac nomenclature carboxylic acids have an oic acid suffix (e.g. octadecanoic acid) for trivial names the suffix is usually ic acid (e.g. stearic acid)
== carboxyl radicaledit ==
the radical cooh (cas# 2564-86-5) has only a separate fleeting existence the acid dissociation constant of cooh has been measured using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy the carboxyl group tends to dimerise to form oxalic acid
== physical propertiesedit ==
=== solubilityedit ===
carboxylic acids are polar because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl -c=o) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl -oh) they also participate in hydrogen bonding together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms the functional group carboxyl carboxylic acids usually exist as dimeric pairs in nonpolar media due to their tendency to self-associate smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water whereas higher carboxylic acids are less soluble due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain these longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols
=== boiling pointsedit ===
carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water not only because of their increased surface area but because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers for boiling to occur either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised both of which increase the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly
=== acidityedit ===
carboxylic acids are brnsted-lowry acids because they are proton (h+) donors they are the most common type of organic acid
carboxylic acids are typically weak acids meaning that they only partially dissociate into h+ cations and rcoo anions in neutral aqueous solution for example at room temperature in a 1-molar solution of acetic acid only 0.4% of the acid molecules are dissociated electronegative substituents give stronger acids
deprotonation of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are resonance stabilized because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms increasing the stability of the anion each of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character
=== odoredit ===
carboxylic acids often have strong odors especially the volatile derivatives most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid (human vomit) conversely esters of carboxylic acids tend to have pleasant odors and many are used in perfume
== characterizationedit ==
carboxylic acids are readily identified as such by infrared spectroscopy they exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the c-o vibration bond (c=o) between 1680 and 1725 cm1 a characteristic o-h band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000 cm1 region by 1h nmr spectrometry the hydroxyl hydrogen appears in the 1013 ppm region although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water
== occurrence and applicationsedit ==
many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale they are also pervasive in nature esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins
carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers pharmaceuticals solvents and food additives industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar precursor to solvents and coatings) acrylic and methacrylic acids (precursors to polymers adhesives) adipic acid (polymers) citric acid (beverages) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (chelating agent) fatty acids (coatings) maleic acid (polymers) propionic acid (food preservative) terephthalic acid (polymers)

=== industrial routesedit ===
in general industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on smaller scale because they require specialized equipment
oxidation of aldehydes with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts the required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by hydroformylation
oxidation of hydrocarbons using air for simple alkanes the method is nonselective but so inexpensive to be useful allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations alkyl groups on a benzene ring oxidized to the carboxylic acid regardless of its chain length benzoic acid from toluene and terephthalic acid from para-xylene and phthalic acid from ortho-xylene are illustrative large-scale conversions acrylic acid is generated from propene
base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols
carbonylation is versatile method when coupled to the addition of water this method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary carbocations e.g isobutylene to pivalic acid in the koch reaction the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids acetic acid and formic acid are produced by the carbonylation of methanol conducted with iodide and alkoxide promoters respectively and often with high pressures of carbon monoxide usually involving additional hydrolytic steps hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and co such reactions are sometimes called "reppe chemistry":
hcch + co + h2o ch2=chco2h
some long-chain carboxylic acids are obtained by the hydrolysis of triglycerides obtained from plant or animal oils; these methods are related to soap making
fermentation of ethanol is used in the production of vinegar
=== laboratory methodsedit ===
preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents
oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes with strong oxidants such as potassium dichromate jones reagent potassium permanganate or sodium chlorite the method is amenable to laboratory conditions compared to the industrial use of air which is "greener," since it yields less inorganic side products such as chromium or manganese oxides
oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozonolysis potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate
carboxylic acids can also be obtained by the hydrolysis of nitriles esters or amides in general with acid- or base-catalysis
carbonation of a grignard and organolithium reagents:
rli + co2 rco2li
rco2li + hcl rco2h + licl
halogenation followed by hydrolysis of methyl ketones in the haloform reaction
the kolbe-schmitt reaction provides a route to salicylic acid precursor to aspirin
=== less-common reactionsedit ===
many reactions afford carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest:
disproportionation of an aldehyde in the cannizzaro reaction
rearrangement of diketones in the benzilic acid rearrangement involving the generation of benzoic acids are the von richter reaction from nitrobenzenes and the kolbe-schmitt reaction from phenols
== reactionsedit ==
the most widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters amides carboxylate salts acid chlorides and alcohols carboxylic acids react with bases to form carboxylate salts in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (-oh) group is replaced with a metal cation thus acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to form sodium acetate carbon dioxide and water:
ch3cooh + nahco3 ch3coona+ + co2 + h2o
carboxylic acids also react with alcohols to give esters this process is heavily used in the production of polyesters likewise carboxylic acids are converted into amides but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine instead esters are typical precursors to amides the conversion of amino acids into peptides is a major biochemical process that requires atp
the hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides in nature carboxylic acids are converted to thioesters
carboxylic acid can be reduced to the alcohol by hydrogenation or using stoichiometric hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride
n,n-dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction it selectively activate the carboxylic acid and is known to tolerate active functionalities such as ketone as well as the moderate ester olefin nitrile and halide moeties
=== specialized reactionsedit ===
as with all carbonyl compounds the protons on the -carbon are labile due to keto-enol tautomerization thus the -carbon is easily halogenated in the hellvolhardzelinsky halogenation
the schmidt reaction converts carboxylic acids to amines
carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the hunsdiecker reaction
the dakinwest reaction converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone
in the barbierwieland degradation an carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain having a simple the methylene bridge at the alpha position can have the chain shortened by one carbon the inverse procedure is the arndteistert synthesis where an acid is converted into acyl halide which is then reacted with diazomethane to give one additional methylene in the aliphatic chain
many acids undergo oxidative decarboxylation enzymes that catalyze these reactions are known as carboxylases (ec 6.4.1) and decarboxylases (ec 4.1.1)
carboxylic acids are reduced to aldehydes via the ester and dibal via the acid chloride in the rosenmund reduction and via the thioester in the fukuyama reduction
in ketonic decarboxylation carboxylic acids are converted to ketones
the kolbe electrolysis is an electrolytic decarboxylative dimerization reaction in other words it gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid molecules and joins the remaining fragments together
