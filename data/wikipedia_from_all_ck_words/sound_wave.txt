in physics sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement through a medium such as air or water in physiology and psychology sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain
== acousticsedit ==
acoustics is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustical engineering may be called an acoustical engineer an audio engineer on the other hand is concerned with the recording manipulation mixing and reproduction of sound
applications of acoustics are found in almost all aspects of modern society subdisciplines include aeroacoustics audio signal processing architectural acoustics bioacoustics electro-acoustics environmental noise musical acoustics noise control psychoacoustics speech ultrasound underwater acoustics and vibration
== definitionedit ==
sound is defined by ansi/asa s1.1-2013 as (a) oscillation in pressure stress particle displacement particle velocity etc. propagated in a medium with internal forces (e.g. elastic or viscous) or the superposition of such propagated oscillation (b) auditory sensation evoked by the oscillation described in (a).
== physics of soundedit ==
sound can propagate through compressible media such as air water and solids as longitudinal waves and also as a transverse waves in solids (see longitudinal and transverse waves below) the sound waves are generated by a sound source such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker the sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium as the source continues to vibrate the medium the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound thus forming the sound wave at a fixed distance from the source the pressure velocity and displacement of the medium vary in time at an instant in time the pressure velocity and displacement vary in space note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave this is intuitively obvious for a solid and the same is true for liquids and gases (that is the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations while the average position of the particles over time does not change) during propagation waves can be reflected refracted or attenuated by the medium
the behavior of sound propagation is generally affected by three things
a relationship between density and pressure this relationship affected by temperature determines the speed of sound within the medium
the propagation is also affected by the motion of the medium itself for example sound moving through wind independent of the motion of sound through the medium if the medium is moving the sound is further transported
the viscosity of the medium also affects the motion of sound waves it determines the rate at which sound is attenuated for many media such as air or water attenuation due to viscosity is negligible
when sound is moving through a medium that does not have constant physical properties it may be refracted (either dispersed or focused)
the mechanical vibrations that can be interpreted as sound are able to travel through all forms of matter gases liquids solids and plasmas the matter that supports the sound is called the medium sound cannot travel through a vacuum
=== longitudinal and transverse wavesedit ===
sound is transmitted through gases plasma and liquids as longitudinal waves also called compression waves it requires a medium to propagate through solids however it can be transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure causing local regions of compression and rarefaction while transverse waves (in solids) are waves of alternating shear stress at right angle to the direction of propagation
sound waves may be viewed using parabolic mirrors and objects that produce sound
the energy carried by an oscillating sound wave converts back and forth between the potential energy of the extra compression (in case of longitudinal waves) or lateral displacement strain (in case of transverse waves) of the matter and the kinetic energy of the displacement velocity of particles of the medium
=== sound wave properties and characteristicsedit ===
sound waves are often simplified to a description in terms of sinusoidal plane waves which are characterized by these generic properties
frequency or its inverse the period
wavelength
wave number
amplitude
sound pressure
sound intensity
speed of sound
direction
sound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies from about 20 hz to 20,000 hz in air at standard temperature and pressure the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17 m to 17 mm sometimes speed and direction are combined as a velocity vector wave number and direction are combined as a wave vector
transverse waves also known as shear waves have the additional property polarization and are not a characteristic of sound waves
=== speed of soundedit ===
the speed of sound depends on the medium that the waves pass through and is a fundamental property of the material the first significant effort towards the measure of the speed of sound was made by newton he believed that the speed of sound in a particular substance was equal to the square root of the pressure acting on it (stp) divided by its density
this was later proven wrong when found to incorrectly derive the speed french mathematician laplace corrected the formula by deducing that the phenomenon of sound travelling is not isothermal as believed by newton but adiabatic he added another factor to the equation-gamma-and multiplied to  thus coming up with the equation  since the final equation came up to be which is also known as the newton-laplace equation in this equation k = elastic bulk modulus c = velocity of sound and = density thus the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the bulk modulus of the medium to its density
those physical properties and the speed of sound change with ambient conditions for example the speed of sound in gases depends on temperature in 20 c (68 f) air at sea level the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s (1,230 km/h 767 mph) using the formula v = (331 + 0.6 t) m/s in fresh water also at 20 c the speed of sound is approximately 1,482 m/s (5,335 km/h 3,315 mph) in steel the speed of sound is about 5,960 m/s (21,460 km/h 13,330 mph) the speed of sound is also slightly sensitive (a second-order anharmonic effect) to the sound amplitude which means that there are non-linear propagation effects such as the production of harmonics and mixed tones not present in the original sound (see parametric array)
== perception of soundedit ==
a distinct use of the term sound from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology where the term refers to the subject of perception by the brain the field of psychoacoustics is dedicated to such studies
the physical reception of sound in any hearing organism is limited to a range of frequencies humans normally hear sound frequencies between approximately 20 hz and 20,000 hz (20 khz),:382 the upper limit decreases with age
other species have a different range of hearing for example dogs can perceive vibrations higher than 20 khz but are deaf below 40 hz as a signal perceived by one of the major senses sound is used by many species for detecting danger navigation predation and communication earth's atmosphere water and virtually any physical phenomenon such as fire rain wind surf or earthquake produces (and is characterized by) its unique sounds many species such as frogs birds marine and terrestrial mammals have also developed special organs to produce sound in some species these produce song and speech furthermore humans have developed culture and technology (such as music telephone and radio) that allows them to generate record transmit and broadcast sound
sometimes sound refers to only those vibrations with frequencies that are within the hearing range for humans or for a particular animal
=== elements of sound perceptionedit ===
there are six experimentally separable ways in which sound waves are analysed they are pitch duration loudness timbre texture and spatial location
pitch is perceived as how low or high a sound is and represents the cyclic repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound
duration is perceived as how long or short a sound is and relates to onset and offset signals created by nerve responses to sounds the duration of a sound usually lasts from the time the sound is first noticed until the sound is identified as having changed or ceased
loudness is perceived as how loud or soft a sound is and relates to the totalled number of auditory nerve stimulations over short cyclic time periods most likely over the duration of theta wave cycles
timbre is perceived as the quality of different sounds (e.g the thud of a fallen rock the whir of a drill the tone of a musical instrument or the quality of a voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound this identity is based on information gained from frequency transients noisiness unsteadiness perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame
texture relates to the cognitive separation of auditory objects in a musical context it represents the number of sound sources that can be differentiated and the interaction between them
spatial location (see sound localization) represents the cognitive placement of a sound in an environmental context including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and vertical plane the distance from the sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment
=== noiseedit ===
noise is a term often used to refer to an unwanted sound in science and engineering noise is an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal
=== soundscapeedit ===
soundscape is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived by humans the acoustic environment is the combination of all sounds (whether audible to humans or not) within a given area as modified by the environment
== sound pressure leveledit ==
sound pressure is the difference in a given medium between average local pressure and the pressure in the sound wave a square of this difference (i.e. a square of the deviation from the equilibrium pressure) is usually averaged over time and/or space and a square root of this average provides a root mean square (rms) value for example 1 pa rms sound pressure (94 dbspl) in atmospheric air implies that the actual pressure in the sound wave oscillates between (1 atm pa) and (1 atm pa) that is between 101323.6 and 101326.4 pa as the human ear can detect sounds with a wide range of amplitudes sound pressure is often measured as a level on a logarithmic decibel scale the sound pressure level (spl) or lp is defined as
where p is the root-mean-square sound pressure and is a reference sound pressure commonly used reference sound pressures defined in the standard ansi s1.1-1994 are 20 pa in air and 1 pa in water without a specified reference sound pressure a value expressed in decibels cannot represent a sound pressure level
since the human ear does not have a flat spectral response sound pressures are often frequency weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely the international electrotechnical commission (iec) has defined several weighting schemes a-weighting attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and a-weighted sound pressure levels are labeled dba c-weighting is used to measure peak levels
