friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces fluid layers and material elements sliding against each other there are several types of friction
dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact dry friction is subdivided into static friction ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces and kinetic friction between moving surfaces
fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other
lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces
skin friction is a component of drag the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body
internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation
when surfaces in contact move relative to each other the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is it converts work to heat) this property can have dramatic consequences as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs for example when a viscous fluid is stirred another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear which may lead to performance degradation and/or damage to components friction is a component of the science of tribology
friction is not itself a fundamental force dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion surface roughness surface deformation and surface contamination the complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from first principles impractical and necessitates the use of empirical methods for analysis and the development of theory
== historyedit ==
the classic rules of sliding friction were discovered by leonardo da vinci (14521519) but remained unpublished in his notebooks they were rediscovered by guillaume amontons (1699) amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together this view was further elaborated by belidor (representation of rough surfaces with spherical asperities 1737) and leonhard euler (1750) who derived the angle of repose of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction a different explanation was provided by desaguliers (1725) who demonstrated the strong cohesion forces between lead spheres of which a small cap is cut off and which were then brought into contact with each other
the understanding of friction was further developed by charles-augustin de coulomb (1785) coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on friction the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings the extent of the surface area the normal pressure (or load) and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose) coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity temperature and humidity in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed the distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in coulomb's friction law (see below) although this distinction was already drawn by johann andreas von segner in 1758 the effect of the time of repose was explained by musschenbroek (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials with fibers meshing together which takes a finite time in which the friction increases
john leslie (17661832) noted a weakness in the views of amontons and coulomb if friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive asperities why isn't it balanced then through descending the opposite slope leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by desaguliers which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion in his view friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening pressing down asperities which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before
arthur morrin (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction osborne reynolds (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow this completed the classic empirical model of friction (static kinetic and fluid) commonly used today in engineering in 1877 fleeming jenkin and j a ewing investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction in their paper on friction between surfaces moving at low speeds
the focus of research during the last century has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction f phillip bowden and david tabor (1950) showed that at a microscopic level the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area this actual area of contact caused by asperities (roughness) increases with pressure the development of the atomic force microscope (1986) has recently enabled scientists to study friction at the atomic scale showing on an atomic scale dry friction is the product of the inter-surface shear stress and the contact area these two discoveries explain the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces
== laws of dry frictionedit ==
the elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws
amontons first law the force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load
amontons second law the force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact
coulomb's law of friction kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity
== dry frictionedit ==
dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact the two regimes of dry friction are static friction ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces and kinetic friction (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces
coulomb friction named after charles-augustin de coulomb is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction it is governed by the model
where
is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other it is parallel to the surface in a direction opposite to the net applied force
is the coefficient of friction which is an empirical property of the contacting materials
is the normal force exerted by each surface on the other directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface
the coulomb friction may take any value from zero up to  and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction thus in the static case the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces it balances the net force tending to cause such motion in this case rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force the coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force above which motion would commence this maximum force is known as traction
the force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces for example a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down for an example of potential movement the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward if they did not the wheels would spin and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road
=== normal forceedit ===
the normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces in the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity where  in this case the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object the acceleration due to gravity and the coefficient of friction however the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume it depends only on the material for instance a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block however the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force and hence on the mass of the block
if an object is on a level surface and the force tending to cause it to slide is horizontal the normal force between the object and the surface is just its weight which is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to earth's gravity g if the object is on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane the normal force is less because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane therefore the normal force and ultimately the frictional force is determined using vector analysis usually via a free body diagram depending on the situation the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity
=== coefficient of frictionedit ===
the coefficient of friction (cof) often symbolized by the greek letter  is a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together the coefficient of friction depends on the materials used for example ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one
for surfaces at rest relative to each other  where is the coefficient of static friction this is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart
for surfaces in relative motion  where is the coefficient of kinetic friction the coulomb friction is equal to  and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface
arthur morin introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction the coefficient of friction is an empirical measurement it has to be measured experimentally and cannot be found through calculations rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact for a given pair of surfaces the coefficient of static friction is usually larger than that of kinetic friction in some sets the two coefficients are equal such as teflon-on-teflon
most dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6 values outside this range are rarer but teflon for example can have a coefficient as low as 0.04 a value of zero would mean no friction at all an elusive property rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2 occasionally it is maintained that is always < 1 but this is not true while in most relevant applications < 1 a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object for example silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1
while it is often stated that the cof is a material property, it is better categorized as a system property. unlike true material properties (such as conductivity dielectric constant yield strength) the cof for any two materials depends on system variables like temperature velocity atmosphere and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials for example a copper pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a cof that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating the latter speed of course does not determine the cof uniquely if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly the temperature drops the pin remains solid and the cof rises to that of a low speed test
==== approximate coefficients of frictionedit ====
under certain conditions some materials have very low friction coefficients an example is (highly ordered pyrolytic) graphite which can have a friction coefficient below 0.01 this ultralow-friction regime is called superlubricity
==== negative coefficient of frictionedit ====
as of 2012 a single study has demonstrated the potential for an effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction this contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction this was reported in the journal nature in october 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen
=== static frictionedit ===
static friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other for example static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface the coefficient of static friction typically denoted as s is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction
the static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move the maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force  when there is no sliding occurring the friction force can have any value from zero up to  any force smaller than attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction any force larger than overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur the instant sliding occurs static friction is no longer applicablethe friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction
an example of static friction is the force that prevents a car wheel from slipping as it rolls on the ground even though the wheel is in motion the patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the ground so it is static rather than kinetic friction
the maximum value of static friction when motion is impending is sometimes referred to as limiting friction although this term is not used universally it is also known as traction
=== kinetic frictionedit ===
kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a sled on the ground) the coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted as k and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the same materials however richard feynman comments that with dry metals it is very hard to show any difference. the friction force between two surfaces after sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction and the normal force 
new models are beginning to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction kinetic friction is now understood in many cases to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces rather than interlocking asperities however in many other cases roughness effects are dominant for example in rubber to road friction surface roughness and contact area however do affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces
the origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be explained by thermodynamics upon sliding new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact and existing surface disappears at the front of it since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy work must be spent in creating the new surface and energy is released as heat in removing the surface thus a force is required to move the back of the contact and frictional heat is released at the front
=== angle of frictionedit ===
for certain applications it is more useful to define static friction in terms of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding this is called the angle of friction or friction angle it is defined as
where is the angle from horizontal and s is the static coefficient of friction between the objects this formula can also be used to calculate s from empirical measurements of the friction angle
=== friction at the atomic leveledit ===
determining the forces required to move atoms past each other is a challenge in designing nanomachines in 2008 scientists for the first time were able to move a single atom across a surface and measure the forces required using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5 k) a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom and a carbon monoxide molecule across surfaces of copper and platinum
=== limitations of the coulomb modeledit ===
the coulomb approximation mathematically follows from the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over a small fraction of their overall area that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation which takes place when all area is in atomic contact) and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from leonardo da vinci) such reasoning aside however the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct it is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction the strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces) the coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems
when the surfaces are conjoined coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force or a negative normal force) in this case the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason however despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications
=== numerical simulation of the coulomb modeledit ===
despite being a simplified model of friction the coulomb model is useful in many numerical simulation applications such as multibody systems and granular material even its most simple expression encapsulates the fundamental effects of sticking and sliding which are required in many applied cases although specific algorithms have to be designed in order to efficiently numerically integrate mechanical systems with coulomb friction and bilateral and/or unilateral contact some quite nonlinear effects such as the so-called painlev paradoxes may be encountered with coulomb friction
=== dry friction and instabilitiesedit ===
dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction these instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities) or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the adams-martins instabilities) the latter were originally discovered in 1995 by george g adams and joo armnio correia martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces in particular friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the song of a glass harp phenomena which involve stick and slip modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity
a practically important case is the self-oscillation of the strings of bowed instruments such as the violin cello hurdy-gurdy erhu etc
a connection between dry friction and flutter instability in a simple mechanical system has been discovered
frictional instabilities can lead to the formation of new self-organized patterns (or secondary structures") at the sliding interface such as in-situ formed tribofilms which are utilized for the reduction of friction and wear in so-called self-lubricating materials
== fluid frictionedit ==
fluid friction occurs between layers within a fluid that are moving relative to each other this internal resistance to flow is described as viscosity in everyday terms viscosity of a fluid is said to have thickness thus water is thin having a lower viscosity while honey is thick having a higher viscosity the less viscous the fluid the greater its ease of movement
all real fluids (except superfluids) have some resistance to stress and therefore are viscous but a fluid which has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal fluid or inviscid fluid
== lubricated frictionedit ==
lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces
in most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment with only mild wear and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings when lubrication breaks down metal or other components can rub destructively over each other causing heat and possibly damage or failure
== skin frictionedit ==
skin friction arises from the friction of the fluid against the skin of the object that is moving through it skin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity
skin friction is caused by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object there are two ways to decrease skin friction the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible like an airfoil the second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable
== internal frictionedit ==
internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation
plastic deformation in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object this change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature the change of an object's shape is called strain the force causing it is called stress
elastic deformation in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object stress does not necessarily cause permanent change as deformation occurs internal forces oppose the applied force if the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed this is known as elastic deformation or elasticity
== other types of frictionedit ==
=== rolling resistanceedit ===
rolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object and/or surface generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001 one of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of motor vehicle tires on a road a process which generates heat and sound as by-products
=== triboelectric effectedit ===
rubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of electrostatic charge which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present when the static build-up discharges explosions can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture
=== belt frictionedit ===
belt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley when one end is being pulled the resulting tension which acts on both ends of the belt can be modeled by the belt friction equation
in practice the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support this helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks
== reducing frictionedit ==
=== devicesedit ===
devices such as wheels ball bearings roller bearings and air cushion or other types of fluid bearings can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction
many thermoplastic materials such as nylon hdpe and ptfe are commonly used in low friction bearings they are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load for improved wear resistance very high molecular weight grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings
=== lubricantsedit ===
a common way to reduce friction is by using a lubricant such as oil water or grease which is placed between the two surfaces often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction the science of friction and lubrication is called tribology lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science especially to industrial or commercial objectives
superlubricity a recently discovered effect has been observed in graphite it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects approaching zero levels a very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated
lubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and talc acoustic lubrication actually uses sound as a lubricant
another way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts this can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise known as dither
== energy of frictionedit ==
according to the law of conservation of energy no energy is destroyed due to friction though it may be lost to the system of concern energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy a sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface since heat quickly dissipates many early philosophers including aristotle wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force
when an object is pushed along a surface along a path c the energy converted to heat is given by a line integral in accordance with the definition of work
where
is the friction force
is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing against the object's motion
is the coefficient of kinetic friction which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g if the material changes along the path)
is the position of the object
energy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic irreversibility
=== work of frictionedit ===
in the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces static friction does no work because there is never displacement between the surfaces in the same reference frame kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion and does negative work however friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference one can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug then pulling on the rug quickly in this case the box slides backwards relative to the rug but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary thus the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves doing positive work
the work done by friction can translate into deformation wear and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces) this can be beneficial as in polishing the work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of friction welding excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction as surfaces are worn by work due to friction fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly
