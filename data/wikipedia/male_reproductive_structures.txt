a petrosomatoglyph is a supposed image of parts of a human or animal body in rock they occur all over the world often functioning as an important form of symbolism used in religious and secular ceremonies such as the crowning of kings some are regarded as artefacts linked to saints or culture heroes
the word comes from the greek petra ("stone") soma ("body") and glyphein ("to carve") feet are the most common; however knees elbows hands head fingers etc. are also found
stylised representations of parts of the body are often open to dispute and are therefore on the fringes of acceptability as identifiable petrosomatoglyphs natural objects such as rock crystals and rock formations which look like petrosomatoglyphs whole animals plants etc. are collectively called "mimeoliths"
