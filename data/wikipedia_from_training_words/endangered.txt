an endangered (en) species is a species which has been categorized by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list as likely to become extinct endangered is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the iucn's schema after critically endangered (cr)
in 2012 the iucn red list featured 3079 animal and 2655 plant species as endangered (en) worldwide the figures for 1998 were respectively 1102 and 1197
many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species for example forbidding hunting restricting land development or creating preserves population numbers trends and species conservation status can be found in the lists of organisms by population
== conservation statusedit ==
the conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct many factors are considered when assessing the conservation status of a species e.g. such statistics as the number remaining the overall increase or decrease in the population over time breeding success rates or known threats the iucn red list of threatened species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system
over 40% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction internationally 199 countries have signed an accord to create biodiversity action plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species in the united states such plans are usually called species recovery plans
== iucn red listedit ==
though labelled a list the iucn red list is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes data deficient (dd) species species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined as well species comprehensively assessed by the iucn's species assessment process those species of near threatened (nt) and least concern (lc) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations though these may be in decline unlike their more general use elsewhere the list uses the terms endangered species and threatened species with particular meanings endangered (en) species lie between vulnerable (vu) and critically endangered (cr) species while threatened species are those species determined to be vulnerable endangered or critically endangered
the iucn categories with examples of animals classified by them include
extinct (ex)
extinct in the wild (ew)
captive individuals survive but there is no free-living natural population
critically endangered (cr)
faces an extremely high risk of extinction in the immediate future
endangered (en)
faces a high risk of extinction in the near future
vulnerable (vu)
faces a high risk of endangerment in the medium term
near-threatened (nt)
may be considered threatened in the near future
least concern (lc)
no immediate threat to species survival
== united statesedit ==
there is data from the united states that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species using species data from the database on the economics and management of endangered species (demes) database and the period that the endangered species act (esa) has been in existence 1970 to 1997 a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment as early as the 1800s humans began noticing the decline of certain species of animals in their usual habitats an example is the whooping crane once abundant from canada to mexico it was estimated in 1941 that only 16 birds remained in the wild another early example of mankind noticing the extinction of species was the introduction of kudzu in the southern united states this fast-growing plant took over the south growing on plants and trees and squelching the life out of them
=== endangered species actedit ===
under the endangered species act in the united states species may be listed as endangered or threatened the salt creek tiger beetle (cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the esa the us fish and wildlife service as well as the national marine fisheries service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species and adding a particular species to the list can be a long controversial process (wilcove & master 2008 p 414)
some endangered species laws are controversial typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered whether restrictions on land development constitute a taking of land by the government the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws also lobbying from hunters and various industries like the petroleum industry construction industry and logging has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws
the bush administration lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species under the obama administration this policy has been reinstated
being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers this effect is potentially reducible such as in china where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species
another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the shoot shovel and shut-up method of clearing endangered species from an area of land some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it they have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat thus removing the problem from their land but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species the effectiveness of the endangered species act which coined the term endangered species has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool nineteen species have been delisted and recovered and 93% of listed species in the northeastern united states have a recovering or stable population
currently 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law this approximation however does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the endangered species act according to natureserve's global conservation status approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish) seventeen percent of vascular plants and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled thus in total between seven and eighteen percent of the united states known animals fungi and plants are near extinction this total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the united states under the endangered species act
== over-huntingedit ==
ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem of all the species who went extinct due to interference from mankind the dodo passenger pigeon great auk tasmanian tiger and steller's sea cow are some of the more well known examples with the bald eagle grizzly bear american bison timber wolf and sea turtle having been hunted to near-extinction many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport however due to major efforts to prevent extinction the bald eagle or haliaeetus leucocephalus is now under the category of least concern on the red list a present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced large whales like the blue whale bowhead whale finback whale gray whale sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the endangered species list actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes including prohibiting all whaling in united states waters the formation of the cites treaty which protects all whales along with the formation of the international whaling commission (iwc) but even though all of these movements have been put in place countries such as japan continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of scientific purposes over-hunting climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future
== invasive speciesedit ==
the introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species in some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives in other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline new species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance
== conservationedit ==
=== captive breedingedit ===
captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings such as wildlife preserves zoos and other conservation facilities captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear
this technique has worked for many species for some time with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of european and asian rulers an example being the pre david's deer however captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g cranes) and fishes (e.g hilsa) additionally if the captive breeding population is too small then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced gene pool and reduce immunity
in 1981 the association of zoos and aquariums (aza) created a species survival plan (ssp) in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding with over 450 ssp plans there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the aza with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population created by taxon advisory groups these programs are commonly created as a last resort effort ssp programs regularly participate in species recovery veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts the aza's species survival plan also has breeding and transfer programs both within and outside of aza - certified zoos and aquariums some animals that are part of ssp programs are giant pandas lowland gorillas and california condors
=== private farmingedit ===
whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations legal for-profit private farming does the opposite it has substantially increased the populations of the southern black rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros dr richard emslie a scientific officer at the iucn said of such programs effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned we have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes there are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching from eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit so many owners are keeping them secure the private sector has been key to helping our work.
conservation experts view the effect of china's turtle farming on the wild turtle populations of china and south-eastern asia many of which are endangered as poorly understood although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with farm-raised turtles in the marketplace the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the visible trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007 they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock the conservation expert peter paul van dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock turtle farmers may therefore seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species
in 2009 researchers in australia managed to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks raising the possibility that fish farming may be able to save the species from overfishing
== countries with endangered animalsedit ==
around the world hundreds of thousands of species are lost to extinction many of them only discovered as remains after they are gone thus not only biological variability but also genetic diversity and perhaps sources of livelihood for future generations are lost an endangered species is a species that may become extinct in the near future throughout history millions of species have disappeared due to natural processes in the past 300 years however humans have increased the rate of extinction
for some plant and animal species living seems to be a daily hazard and humans seem to pose the biggest threat ecological disasters hunting/poaching deforestation and other consequences of human action causes damage to the food chain breeding grounds and habitat
