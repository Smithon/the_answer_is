the mesozoic era /mzzok/ is an interval of geological time from about 252 to 66 million years ago it is also called the age of reptiles a phrase introduced by the 19th century paleontologist gideon mantell who viewed it as dominated by reptiles such as iguanodon megalosaurus plesiosaurus and what are now called pseudosuchia
mesozoic means middle life deriving from the greek prefix meso-/- for between and zon/ meaning animal or living being it is one of three geologic eras of the phanerozoic eon preceded by the paleozoic ("ancient life") and succeeded by the cenozoic ("new life") the era is subdivided into three major periods the triassic jurassic and cretaceous which are further subdivided into a number of epochs and stages
the era began in the wake of the permiantriassic extinction event the largest well-documented mass extinction in earth's history and ended with the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event another mass extinction which is known for having killed off non-avian dinosaurs as well as other plant and animal species the mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic climate and evolutionary activity the era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions the climate of the mesozoic was varied alternating between warming and cooling periods overall however the earth was hotter than it is today non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the late triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the jurassic occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the cretaceous birds first appeared in the jurassic having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs the first mammals also appeared during the mesozoic but would remain smallless than 15 kg (33 lb)until the cenozoic
== geologic periodsedit ==
following the paleozoic the mesozoic extended roughly 186 million years from 252.17 to 66 million years ago when the cenozoic era began this time frame is separated into three geologic periods from oldest to youngest
triassic (252.17 to 201.3 million years ago)
jurassic (201.3 to 145 million years ago)
cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago)
the lower (triassic) boundary is set by the permiantriassic extinction event during which approximately 90% to 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct it is also known as the great dying because it is considered the largest mass extinction in the earth's history the upper (cretaceous) boundary is set at the cretaceoustertiary (kt) extinction event (now more accurately called the cretaceouspaleogene (or kpg) extinction event) which may have been caused by the impactor that created chicxulub crater on the yucatn peninsula towards the late cretaceous large volcanic eruptions are also believed to have contributed to the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event approximately 50% of all genera became extinct including all of the non-avian dinosaurs
=== triassicedit ===
the triassic ranges from 250 million to 200 million years ago the triassic is a desolate transitional state in earth's history between the permian extinction and the lush jurassic period it has three major epochs the early triassic the middle triassic and the late triassic
the early triassic lived between 250 million to 247 million years ago and was dominated by deserts as pangaea had not yet broken up thus the interior was nothing but arid the earth had just witnessed a massive die-off in which 95% of all life went extinct the most common life on earth were lystrosaurus labyrinthodont and euparkeria along with many other creatures that managed to survive the great dying temnospondyli evolved during this time and would be the dominant predator for much of the triassic
the middle triassic spans from 247 million to 237 million years ago the middle triassic featured the beginnings of the breakup of pangaea and the beginning of the tethys sea the ecosystem had recovered from the devastation that was the great dying phytoplankton coral and crustaceans all had recovered and the reptiles began to get bigger and bigger new aquatic reptiles evolved such as ichthyosaurs and nothosaurs meanwhile on land pine forests flourished bringing along mosquitoes and fruit flies the first ancient crocodilians evolved which sparked competition with the large amphibians that had since ruled the freshwater world
the late triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago following the bloom of the middle triassic the late triassic featured frequent heat spells as well as moderate precipitation (10-20 inches per year) the recent warming led to a boom of reptilian evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolve as well as pterosaurs all this climatic change however resulted in a large die-out known as the triassic-jurassic extinction event in which all archosaurs (excluding ancient crocodiles) synapsids and almost all large amphibians went extinct as well as 34% of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event of the world the cause is debatable
=== jurassicedit ===
the jurassic ranges from 200 million years to 145 million years ago and features 3 major epochs the early jurassic the middle jurassic and the late jurassic
the early jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago the climate was much more humid than the triassic and as a result the world was very tropical in the oceans plesiosaurs ichthyosaurs and ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas on land dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land with species such as dilophosaurus at the top the first true crocodiles evolved pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction all-in-all reptiles rise to rule the world meanwhile the first true mammals evolve but remained relatively small sized
the middle jurassic spans from 175 million to 163 million years ago during this epoch reptiles flourished as huge herds of sauropods such as brachiosaurus and diplodocus filled the fern prairies of the middle jurassic many other predators rose as well such as allosaurus conifer forests made up a large portion of the forests in the oceans plesiosaurs were quite common and ichthyosaurs were flourishing this epoch was the peak of the reptiles
the late jurassic spans from 163 million to 145 million years ago the late jurassic featured a massive extinction of sauropods and ichthyosaurs due to the separation of pangaea into laurasia and gondwana in an extinction known as the jurassic-cretaceous extinction sea levels rose destroying fern prairies and creating shallows in its wake ichthyosaurs went extinct whereas sauropods as a whole did not die out in the jurassic in fact some species like the titanosaurus lived up to the k-t extinction the increase in sea-levels opened up the atlantic sea way which would continue to get larger over time the divided world would give opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs
=== cretaceousedit ===
the cretaceous is the longest period in the mesozoic but has only two epochs the early cretaceous and the late cretaceous
the early cretaceous spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago the early cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways and as a result the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in south america) many coastal shallows were created and that caused ichthyosaurs to die out mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas some island-hopping dinosaurs like eustreptospondylus evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient europe other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the jurassic-cretaceous extinction left behind such as carcharodontosaurus and spinosaurus of the most successful would be the iguanodon which spread to every continent seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests year-round and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like muttaburrasaurus since it was too cold for crocodiles it was the last stronghold for large amphibians like koolasuchus pterosaurs got larger as species like tapejara and ornithocheirus evolved
the late cretaceous spans from 100 million to 65 million years ago the late cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue on in the cenozoic period eventually tropics were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes in weather dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus triceratops and hadrosaurs dominated the food web in the oceans mosasaurs ruled the seas to fill the role of the ichthyosaurs and huge plesiosaurs such as elasmosaurus evolved also the first flowering plants evolved at the end of the cretaceous the deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere as this was continuing it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth creating the chicxulub crater in an event known as the k-t extinction the fifth and most recent mass extinction event in which 75% of life on earth went extinct including all non-avian dinosaurs everything over 10 kilograms went extinct the age of the dinosaurs was over
== paleogeography and tectonicsedit ==
compared to the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late paleozoic mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild the sole major mesozoic orogeny occurred in what is now the arctic creating the innuitian orogeny the brooks range the verkhoyansk and cherskiy ranges in siberia and the khingan mountains in manchuria this orogeny was related to the opening of the arctic ocean and subduction of the north china and siberian cratons under the pacific ocean nevertheless the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent pangaea pangaea gradually split into a northern continent laurasia and a southern continent gondwana this created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the atlantic coastline (such as along the u.s east coast) today
by the end of the era the continents had rifted into nearly their present form laurasia became north america and eurasia while gondwana split into south america africa australia antarctica and the indian subcontinent which collided with the asian plate during the cenozoic the impact giving rise to the himalayas
== climateedit ==
the triassic was generally dry a trend that began in the late carboniferous and highly seasonal especially in the interior of pangaea low sea levels may have also exacerbated temperature extremes with its high specific heat capacity water acts as a temperature-stabilizing heat reservoir and land areas near large bodies of waterespecially the oceansexperience less variation in temperature because much of the land that constituted pangaea was distant from the oceans temperatures fluctuated greatly and the interior of pangaea probably included expansive areas of desert abundant red beds and evaporites such as halite support these conclusions but evidence exists that the generally dry climate of the triassic was punctuated by episodes of increased rainfall most important humid episodes were the carnian pluvial event and one in the rhaetian few million years before the triassicjurassic extinction event
sea levels began to rise during the jurassic which was probably caused by an increase in seafloor spreading the formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m (656 ft) more than today which flooded coastal areas furthermore pangaea began to rift into smaller divisions bringing more land area in contact with the ocean by forming the tethys sea temperatures continued to increase and began to stabilize humidity also increased with the proximity of water and deserts retreated
the climate of the cretaceous is less certain and more widely disputed higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are thought to have caused the world temperature gradient from north to south to become almost flat temperatures were about the same across the planet average temperatures were also higher than today by about 10c in fact by the middle cretaceous equatorial ocean waters (perhaps as warm as 20 c in the deep ocean) may have been too warm for sea life and land areas near the equator may have been deserts despite their proximity to water the circulation of oxygen to the deep ocean may also have been disrupted for this reason large volumes of organic matter that was unable to decompose accumulated eventually being deposited as black shale
not all of the data support these hypotheses however even with the overall warmth temperature fluctuations should have been sufficient for the presence of polar ice caps and glaciers but there is no evidence of either quantitative models have also been unable to recreate the flatness of the cretaceous temperature gradient
different studies have come to different conclusions about the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere during different parts of the mesozoic with some concluding oxygen levels were lower than the current level (about 21%) throughout the mesozoic some concluding they were lower in the triassic and part of the jurassic but higher in the cretaceous and some concluding they were higher throughout most or all of the triassic jurassic and cretaceous
== lifeedit ==
=== floraedit ===
the dominant land plant species of the time were gymnosperms which are vascular cone-bearing non-flowering plants such as conifers that produce seeds without a coating this is opposed to the earth's current flora in which the dominant land plants in terms of number of species are angiosperms one particular plant genus ginkgo is thought to have evolved at this time and is represented today by a single species ginkgo biloba as well the extant genus sequoia is believed to have evolved in the mesozoic
some plant species had distributions that were markedly different from succeeding periods for example the schizeales a fern order were skewed to the northern hemisphere in the mesozoic but are now better represented in the southern hemisphere
=== faunaedit ===
the extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the permian period allowed for the radiation of many new lifeforms in particular the extinction of the large herbivorous pareiasaurs and carnivorous gorgonopsians left those ecological niches empty some were filled by the surviving cynodonts and dicynodonts the latter of which subsequently became extinct
recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity complex food webs and a variety of niches took much longer to reestablish recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-triassic 4m to 6m years after the extinction and was not complete until 30m years after the permiantriassic extinction event animal life was then dominated by various archosaurian reptiles dinosaurs pterosaurs and aquatic reptiles such as ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs and mosasaurs
the climatic changes of the late jurassic and cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation the jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity and the first birds and eutherian mammals also appeared angiosperms radiated sometime in the early cretaceous first in the tropics but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period by the end of the cretaceous angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycad and ferns until after the cretaceouspaleogene extinction
some have argued that insects diversified with angiosperms because insect anatomy especially the mouth parts seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants however all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose
as the temperatures in the seas increased the larger animals of the early mesozoic gradually began to disappear while smaller animals of all kinds including lizards snakes and perhaps primates evolved the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event exacerbated this trend the large archosaurs became extinct while birds and mammals thrived as they do today
