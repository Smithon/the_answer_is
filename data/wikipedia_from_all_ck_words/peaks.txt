in the context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth's moon
the world's first artificial satellite the sputnik 1 was launched by the soviet union in 1957 since then thousands of satellites have been launched into orbit around the earth some satellites notably space stations have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit artificial satellites originate from more than 40 countries and have used the satellite launching capabilities of ten nations a few hundred satellites are currently operational whereas thousands of unused satellites and satellite fragments orbit the earth as space debris a few space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn vesta eros ceres and the sun
satellites are used for a large number of purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and research satellites space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known (overlapping) classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit
about 6,600 satellites have been launched the latest estimates are that 3,600 remain in orbit of those about 1,000 are operational the rest have lived out their useful lives and are part of the space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit (at 20,000 km) the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000 km)
satellites are propelled by rockets to their orbits usually the launch vehicle itself is a rocket lifting off from a launch pad on land in a minority of cases satellites are launched at sea (from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform) or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit)
satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control
== historyedit ==
=== early conceptionsedit ===
newton's cannonball presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite
the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit is a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon the story is serialized in the atlantic monthly starting in 1869 the idea surfaces again in jules verne's the begum's fortune (1879)
in 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky (18571935) published exploring space using jet propulsion devices (in russian ) which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit around the earth at 8 km/s and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could be used to achieve this he proposed the use of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen though other combinations can be used
in 1928 slovenian herman potonik (18921929) published his sole book the problem of space travel the rocket motor (german das problem der befahrung des weltraums der raketen-motor) a plan for a breakthrough into space and a permanent human presence there he conceived of a space station in detail and calculated its geostationary orbit he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments the book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays
in a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke (19172008) described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications clarke examined the logistics of satellite launch possible orbits and other aspects of the creation of a network of world-circling satellites pointing to the benefits of high-speed global communications he also suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet
the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on december 29 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services
=== artificial satellitesedit ===
the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on october 4 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer (there is a crater on the lunar far side which bears his name) this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states
sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1's success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war
sputnik 2 was launched on november 3 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika
in may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century. the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air force's project rand eventually released the above report but did not believe that the satellite was a potential military weapon rather they considered it to be a tool for science politics and propaganda in 1954 the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program. in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle, written by r.r carhart this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite, by h.k kallmann and w.w kellogg
in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year (195758) the white house announced on july 29 1955 that the u.s intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on july 31 the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957
following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the army's which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civilian/navy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on january 31 1958
in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites
early satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous (geo) satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972
the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station
== space surveillance networkedit ==
the united states space surveillance network (ssn) a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earth's orbit since 1957 when the soviets opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26,000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earth's atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites (i.e ~560 satellites) the rest are space debris the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles
a search of the nssdc master catalog at the end of october 2010 listed 6,578 satellites launched into orbit since 1957 the latest being chang'e 2 on 1 october 2010
== non-military satellite servicesedit ==
there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services
=== fixed satellite servicesedit ===
fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth's surface
=== mobile satellite systemsedit ===
mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems
=== scientific research satellites (commercial and noncommercial)edit ===
scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data (e.g remote sensing) amateur (ham) radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research
== typesedit ==
astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects
biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation
communications satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits molniya orbits or low earth orbits
earth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc (see especially earth observing system.)
navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time
killer satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assets
manned spacecraft (spaceships) are large satellites able to put humans into (and beyond) an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations
miniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes new classifications are used to categorize these satellites minisatellite (500100 kg) microsatellite (below 100 kg) nanosatellite (below 10 kg)
reconnaissance satellites are earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified
recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earth
space stations are man-made orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space a space station is distinguished from other manned spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit for periods of weeks months or even years
tether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether
weather satellites are primarily used to monitor earth's weather and climate
== orbit typesedit ==
the first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 2,465 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity
the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit (leo) medium earth orbit (meo) and high earth orbit (heo) low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 km-35,786 km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786 km
=== centric classificationsedit ===
geocentric orbit an orbit around the planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites currently there are approximately 2,465 artificial satellites orbiting the earth
heliocentric orbit an orbit around the sun in our solar system all planets comets and asteroids are in such orbits as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet
areocentric orbit an orbit around the planet mars such as by moons or artificial satellites
the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links

molniya orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and orbital period of half of a sidereal day (roughly 12 hours) such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet (specifically russia and the united states)
tundra orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and orbital period of one sidereal day (roughly 24 hours) such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet
=== synchronous classificationsedit ===
synchronous orbit an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period (earth's is 23 hours 56 minutes 4.091 seconds) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky
semi-synchronous orbit (sso) an orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200 km (12,600 mi) and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period (earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited
geosynchronous orbit (gso) orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 mi) such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky
geostationary orbit (geo) a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.clarke orbit another name for a geostationary orbit named after scientist and writer arthur c clarke
supersynchronous orbit a disposal / storage orbit above gso/geo satellites will drift west also a synonym for disposal orbit
subsynchronous orbit a drift orbit close to but below gso/geo satellites will drift east
graveyard orbit an orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation
disposal orbit a synonym for graveyard orbit

areostationary orbit (aso) a circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17000 km (10557 miles) above the surface to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky
heliosynchronous orbit a heliocentric orbit about the sun where the satellite's orbital period matches the sun's period of rotation these orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 gm (0.1628 au) around the sun a little less than half of the orbital radius of mercury
=== special classificationsedit ===
sun-synchronous orbit an orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets surface at the same local solar time such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging spy and weather satellites
moon orbit the orbital characteristics of earth's moon average altitude of 384,403 kilometers (238,857 mi) ellipticalinclined orbit
=== pseudo-orbit classificationsedit ===
horseshoe orbit an orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in co-orbit with the planet see asteroids 3753 (cruithne) and 2002 aa29
exo-orbit a maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it
suborbital spaceflight a synonym for exo-orbit
lunar transfer orbit (lto)
prograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of less than 90 or rather an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary
retrograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of more than 90 or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude
halo orbit and lissajous orbit orbits around lagrangian points
== satellite subsystemsedit ==
the satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy
=== spacecraft bus or service moduleedit ===
the bus module consists of the following subsystems
==== structural subsystemedit ====
the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage
==== telemetry subsystemedit ====
the telemetry subsystem (aka command and data handling c&dh) monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments
==== power subsystemedit ====
the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earth's shadow nuclear power sources (radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program (19641978)
==== thermal control subsystemedit ====
the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (e.g optical solar reflector)
==== attitude and orbit control subsystemedit ====
the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators (reaction wheels thrusters) to apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas positioning in the right directions
=== communication payloadedit ===
the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of 
receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas)
amplifying received radio signals
sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas)
== end of lifeedit ==
when satellites reach the end of their mission satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009
instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level) the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78 km with a range between 72 and 84 km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95 km
== launch-capable countriesedit ==

== attacks on satellitesedit ==
in recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks
for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008
=== jammingedit ===
due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming
also it is trivial to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively
