== history ==
=== indigenous and european contact ===
the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival some such as the pre-columbian mississippian culture developed advanced agriculture grand architecture and state-level societies after the spanish conquistadors made the first contacts the native population declined for various reasons primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline though it impacted specific tribes and colonial settlements in the hawaiian islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 ad from polynesia captain james cook arrived in the hawaiian islands in 1778 with american contact made in 1790 with the first ship to dock arriving in oahu
in the early days of colonization many european settlers were subject to food shortages disease and attacks from native americans native americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with europeans in their colonial wars at the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other settlers traded for food and animal pelts natives for guns ammunition and other european wares natives taught many settlers where when and how to cultivate corn beans and squash european missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the indians and urged them to adopt european agricultural techniques and lifestyles
=== settlements ===
after columbus first voyage to the new world in 1492 other explorers followed with settlement into the floridas and the american southwest there were also some french attempts to colonize the east coast and later more successful settlements along the mississippi river successful english settlement on the eastern coast of north america began with the virginia colony in 1607 at jamestown and the pilgrims plymouth colony in 1620 early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings many settlers were dissenting christian groups who came seeking religious freedom the continent's first elected legislative assembly virginia's house of burgesses created in 1619 and the mayflower compact signed by the pilgrims before disembarking established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies
most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotch-irish and other groups as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west
slave cultivation of cash crops began with the spanish in the 1500s and was adopted by the english but life expectancy was much higher in north america because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice but by the turn of the 18th century african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions
with the british colonization of georgia in 1732 the 13 colonies that would become the united states of america were established all had local governments with elections open to most free men with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism with extremely high birth rates low death rates and steady settlement the colonial population grew rapidly relatively small native american populations were eclipsed the christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the great awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty
in the french and indian war british forces seized canada from the french but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies excluding the native americans who were being conquered and displaced those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770 about one-third that of britain despite continuing new arrivals the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of americans had been born overseas the colonies distance from britain had allowed the development of self-government but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority
=== independence and expansion (17761865) ===
the american revolutionary war was the first successful colonial war of independence against a european power americans had developed an ideology of republicanism asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures they demanded their rights as englishmen no taxation without representation the british insisted on administering the empire through parliament and the conflict escalated into war
following the passage of the lee resolution on july 2 1776 which was the actual vote for independence the congress adopted the declaration of independence on july 4 which proclaimed in a long preamble that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by great britain and finally declared in the words of the resolution that the thirteen colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the british crown in the united states the fourth day of july is celebrated annually as independence day in 1777 the articles of confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789
britain recognized the independence of the united states following their defeat at yorktown in the peace treaty of 1783 american sovereignty was recognized from the atlantic coast west to the mississippi river nationalists led the philadelphia convention of 1787 in writing the united states constitution ratified in state conventions in 1788 the federal government was reorganized into three branches on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances in 1789 george washington who had led the revolutionary army to victory was the first president elected under the new constitution the bill of rights forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections was adopted in 1791
although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the deep south and along with it the slave population the second great awakening beginning about 1800 converted millions to evangelical protestantism in the north it energized multiple social reform movements including abolitionism in the south methodists and baptists proselytized among slave populations
americans eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of american indian wars the louisiana purchase of french-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size the war of 1812 declared against britain over various grievances and fought to a draw strengthened u.s nationalism a series of u.s military incursions into florida led spain to cede it and other gulf coast territory in 1819 expansion was aided by steam power when steamboats began traveling along america's large water systems which were connected by new canals such as the erie and the i&m then even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land
from 1820 to 1850 jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage it led to the rise of the second party system of democrats and whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854 the trail of tears in the 1830s exemplified the indian removal policy that moved indians into the west to their own reservations the u.s annexed the republic of texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist manifest destiny the 1846 oregon treaty with britain led to u.s control of the present-day american northwest victory in the mexicanamerican war resulted in the 1848 mexican cession of california and much of the present-day american southwest
the california gold rush of 184849 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states after the american civil war new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with native americans over a half-century the loss of the american bison (called buffalo) was an existential blow to many plains indians cultures in 1869 a new peace policy sought to protect native-americans from abuses avoid further war and secure their eventual u.s citizenship although conflicts including several of the largest indian wars continued throughout the west into the 1900s
=== civil war and reconstruction era ===
differences of opinion and social order between northern and southern states in early united states society particularly regarding black slavery ultimately led the u.s into the american civil war initially states entering the union alternated between slave and free states keeping a sectional balance in the senate while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the house of representatives but with additional western territory and more free-soil states tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories whether and how to expand or restrict slavery
with the 1860 election of abraham lincoln the first president from the largely anti-slavery republican party conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the confederate states of america while the u.s federal government maintained that secession was illegal the ensuing war was at first for union then after 1863 as casualties mounted and lincoln delivered his emancipation proclamation a second war aim became abolition of slavery the war remains the deadliest military conflict in american history resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians
following the union victory in 1865 three amendments to the u.s constitution brought about the prohibition of slavery gave u.s citizenship to the nearly four million african americans who had been slaves and promised them voting rights the war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves following the reconstruction era throughout the south jim crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites over the subsequent decades in both the north and the south blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence sparking national movements against these abuses
=== industrialization ===
in the north urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from southern and eastern europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture national infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the american old west the later invention of electric light and the telephone would also impact communication and urban life
the end of the indian wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation increasing surpluses for international markets mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of alaska from russia in 1867 in 1893 pro-american elements in hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the republic of hawaii which the u.s annexed in 1898 puerto rico guam and the philippines were ceded by spain in the same year following the spanishamerican war
rapid economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists and the u.s economy became the world's largest dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist socialist and anarchist movements this period eventually ended with the advent of the progressive era which saw significant reforms in many societal areas including women's suffrage alcohol prohibition regulation of consumer goods greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions

in 1920 the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage the 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television the prosperity of the roaring twenties ended with the wall street crash of 1929 and the onset of the great depression after his election as president in 1932 franklin d roosevelt responded with the new deal which included the establishment of the social security system the great migration of millions of african americans out of the american south began around wwi and extended through the 1960s whereas the dust bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration
the united states was at first effectively neutral during world war ii's early stages but began supplying material to the allies in march 1941 through the lend-lease program on december 7 1941 the empire of japan launched a surprise attack on pearl harbor prompting the united states to join the allies against the axis powers during the war the united states was referred as one of the four policemen of allies power who met to plan the post-war world along with britain the soviet union and china though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence
allied conferences at bretton woods and yalta outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the united states and soviet union at the center of world affairs as an allied victory was won in europe a 1945 international conference held in san francisco produced the united nations charter which became active after the war the united states developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on japan the japanese surrendered on september 2 ending world war ii
=== cold war and civil rights era ===
after world war ii the united states and the soviet union jockeyed for power during what is known as the cold war driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism and according to the school of geopolitics a divide between the maritime atlantic and the continental eurasian camps they dominated the military affairs of europe with the u.s and its nato allies on one side and the ussr and its warsaw pact allies on the other the u.s developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence while the u.s and soviet union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals the two countries avoided direct military conflict
the u.s often opposed third world movements that it viewed as soviet-sponsored american troops fought communist chinese and north korean forces in the korean war of 195053 the soviet union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a space race in which the united states became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969 a proxy war in southeast asia eventually evolved into full american participation as the vietnam war
at home the u.s experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class construction of an interstate highway system transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments in 1959 hawaii became the 50th and last state added to the us a growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination with martin luther king jr becoming a prominent leader and figurehead a combination of court decisions and legislation culminating in the civil rights act of 1964 sought to end racial discrimination meanwhile a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the vietnam war black nationalism and the sexual revolution the launch of a war on poverty expanded entitlement and welfare spending
the 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation after his election in 1980 president ronald reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms following the collapse of dtente he abandoned containment and initiated the more aggressive rollback strategy towards the ussr after a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed
the late 1980s brought a thaw in relations with the ussr and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the cold war this brought about unipolarity with the u.s unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower the concept of pax americana which had appeared in the post-world war ii period gained wide popularity as a term for the post-cold war new world order
=== contemporary history ===
after the cold war the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern u.s history ending in 2001 originating in u.s defense networks the internet spread to international academic networks and then to the public in the 1990s greatly impacting the global economy society and culture on september 11 2001 al-qaeda terrorists struck the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon near washington d.c. killing nearly 3,000 people in response the united states launched the war on terror which includes the ongoing war in afghanistan and the 200311 iraq war

u.s taxation is generally progressive especially the federal income taxes and is among the most progressive in the developed world the highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes and about half of all taxes payroll taxes for social security are a flat regressive tax with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains the historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers however according to the congressional budget office the net effect of social security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile making the system progressive
the top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009 and the top 1% with 13.4% of pre-tax national income paid 22.3% of federal taxes in 2013 the tax policy center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1% 27.2% for the top quintile 13.8% for the middle quintile and 2.7% for the bottom quintile the incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades state and local taxes vary widely but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation

there has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s however the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance while inflation-adjusted ("real") household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999 it has since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently according to congressional research service during this same period immigration to the united states increased while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant and eventually decreasing since 2000 the rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011 has had a significant impact on income inequality leaving the united states with one of the widest income distributions among oecd nations the post-recession income gains have been very uneven with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2012 the extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate

== culture ==
the united states is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups traditions and values aside from the native american native hawaiian and native alaskan populations nearly all americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries mainstream american culture is a western culture largely derived from the traditions of european immigrants with influences from many other sources such as traditions brought by slaves from africa more recent immigration from asia and especially latin america has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics
core american culture was established by protestant british colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic competitiveness and individualism as well as a unifying belief in an american creed emphasizing liberty equality private property democracy rule of law and a preference for limited government americans are extremely charitable by global standards according to a 2006 british study americans gave 1.67% of gdp to charity more than any other nation studied more than twice the second place british figure of 0.73% and around twelve times the french figure of 0.14%
the american dream or the perception that americans enjoy high social mobility plays a key role in attracting immigrants whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate while mainstream culture holds that the united states is a classless society scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes affecting socialization language and values americans self-images social viewpoints and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree while americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute

characteristic dishes such as apple pie fried chicken pizza hamburgers and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants french fries mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos and pasta dishes freely adapted from italian sources are widely consumed americans drink three times as much coffee as tea marketing by u.s industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages
american eating habits owe a great deal to that of their british culinary roots with some variations although american lands could grow newer vegetables england could not most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by europeans over time american foods changed to a point that food critic john l hess stated in 1972 our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence
the american fast food industry the world's largest pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s fast food consumption has sparked health concerns during the 1980s and 1990s americans caloric intake rose 24% frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the american obesity epidemic highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular and sugared beverages account for nine percent of american caloric intake
