california (/klfrnj/ kal--forn-y /klfrni/ kal--fawr-nee-) is a state located on the west coast of the united states it is the most populous u.s state with 39 million people and the third largest state by area (after alaska and texas) california is bordered by oregon to the north nevada to the east arizona to the southeast and the mexican state of baja california to the south it contains the nation's second most populous census statistical area (greater los angeles area) and the fifth most populous (san francisco bay area) and eight of the nation's 50 most populated cities (los angeles san diego san jose san francisco fresno sacramento long beach and oakland) sacramento has been the state capital since 1854
what is now california was first settled by various native american tribes before being explored by a number of european expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries it was then claimed by the spanish empire as part of alta california in the larger territory of new spain alta california became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexicanamerican war the western portion of alta california was organized as the state of california which was admitted as the 31st state on september 9 1850 the california gold rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom
california's diverse geography ranges from the sierra nevada in the east to the pacific coast in the west from the redwooddouglas fir forests of the northwest to the mojave desert areas in the southeast the center of the state is dominated by the central valley a major agricultural area california contains both the highest point (mount whitney) and the lowest point (death valley) in the contiguous united states and it has the 3rd longest coastline of all states (after alaska and florida) earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the pacific ring of fire about 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year but most are too small to be felt
california's economy is centered on technology finance real estate services government and professional scientific and technical business services together comprising 58% of the state economy although only 1.5% of the state's economy california's agriculture industry has the highest output of any u.s state if it were a country california would be the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world and the 34th most populous
== etymology ==
the word california originally referred to the entire region composed of the baja california peninsula of mexico the current u.s states of california nevada and utah and parts of arizona new mexico texas and wyoming
the name california is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by black amazons and ruled by queen calafia the story of calafia is recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandin written as a sequel to amadis de gaula by spanish adventure writer garci rodrguez de montalvo the kingdom of queen calafia according to montalvo was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gold
shortened forms of the state's name include ca cal. calif and us-ca
== geography ==
california is the 3rd largest state in the united states in area after alaska and texas
in the middle of the state lies the california central valley bounded by the sierra nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the cascade range to the north and the tehachapi mountains in the south the central valley is california's agricultural heartland
divided in two by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta the northern portion the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river while the southern portion the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river both areas derive their names from the rivers that flow through them with dredging the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports
the sacramento-san joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley
the channel islands are located off the southern coast
the sierra nevada (spanish for snowy range") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states mount whitney at 14,505 feet (4,421 m) the range embraces yosemite valley famous for its glacially carved domes and sequoia national park home to the giant sequoia trees the largest living organisms on earth and the deep freshwater lake lake tahoe the largest lake in the state by volume
to the east of the sierra nevada are owens valley and mono lake an essential migratory bird habitat in the western part of the state is clear lake the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in california though lake tahoe is larger it is divided by the california/nevada border the sierra nevada falls to arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including palisade glacier the southernmost glacier in the united states
about 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests and california's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state california contains more forestland than any other state except alaska many of the trees in the california white mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old
in the south is a large inland salt lake the salton sea the south-central desert is called the mojave to the northeast of the mojave lies death valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in north america the badwater basin at 279 feet (85 m) the horizontal distance from the bottom of death valley to the top of mount whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km) indeed almost all of southeastern california is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer the southeastern border of california with arizona is entirely formed by the colorado river from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water
along the california coast are several major metropolitan areas including the greater los angeles area the san francisco bay area and the san diego metropolitan area
as part of the ring of fire california is subject to tsunamis floods droughts santa ana winds wildfires landslides on steep terrain and has several volcanoes it has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state in particular the san andreas fault
=== climate ===
even though most of the state has a mediterranean climate due to the large size of the state the climate ranges from subarctic to subtropical the cool california current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers the maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of los angeles and san francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area where areas sheltered from the sea sees significantly hotter summers than nearby areas close to the ocean
northern parts of the state have more rain than the south california's mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes northwestern california has a temperate climate and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast the high mountains including the sierra nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer
california's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters death valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is considered the hottest location in the world the highest temperature in the world 134 f (56.7 c) was recorded there on july 10 1913 the lowest temperature in california was 45 f (43 c) in 1937 in boca
the table below lists average temperatures for august and december in some of the major urban areas of california since extremes like the cool summers of the humboldt bay and the extreme heat of death valley do not effect any major urban areas these are not listed
=== ecology ===
california is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities california is part of the nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions
california's large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the catalina ironwood (lyonothamnus floribundus) many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the california lilac (ceanothus) many california endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat
=== flora and fauna ===
california boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees california's native grasses are perennial plants after european contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of european annual grasses and in modern times california's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer
because california has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower sonoran (desert) upper sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands) transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties) and the canadian hudsonian and arctic zones comprising the state's highest elevations
plant life in the dry climate of the lower sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde the joshua tree is found in the mojave desert flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the central valley the upper sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants nemophila mint phacelia viola and the california poppy (eschscholzia californica) the state flower also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world
the transition zone includes most of california's forests with the redwood (sequoia sempervirens) and the big tree or giant sequoia (sequoiadendron giganteum) among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years) tanbark oak california laurel sugar pine madrona broad-leaved maple and douglas-fir also grow here forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies
the high elevations of the canadian zone allow the jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique sierra puffball is also found here right below the timeberline in the hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow at about 10,500 feet (3,200 m) begins the arctic zone a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers including sierra primrose yellow columbine alpine buttercup and alpine shooting star
common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus acacia pepper tree geranium and scotch broom the species that are federally classified as endangered are the contra costa wallflower antioch dunes evening primrose solano grass san clemente island larkspur salt marsh bird's beak mcdonald's rock-cress and santa barbara island liveforever as of december 1997 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered
in the deserts of the lower sonoran zone the mammals include the jackrabbit kangaroo rat squirrel and opossum common birds include the owl roadrunner cactus wren and various species of hawk the area's reptilian life include the sidewinder viper desert tortoise and horned toad the upper sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope brown-footed woodrat and ring-tailed cat birds unique to this zone are the california thrasher bushtit and california condor
in the transition zone there are colombian black-tailed deer black bears gray foxes cougars bobcats and roosevelt elk reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone in addition amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too birds such as the kingfisher chickadee towhee and hummingbird thrive here as well
the canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel snowshoe hare and several species of chipmunks conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay sierra chickadee sierra hermit thrush water ouzel and townsend's solitaire as one ascends into the hudsonian zone birds become scarcer while the sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high arctic region other bird species such as the hummingbird and clark's nutcracker principal mammals found in this region include the sierra coney white-tailed jackrabbit and the bighorn sheep as of april 2003 the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service the fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer coyote mountain lion northern flicker and several species of hawk and sparrow
aquatic life in california thrives from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky pacific coastline numerous trout species are found among them rainbow golden and cutthroat migratory species of salmon are common as well deep-sea life forms include sea bass yellowfin tuna barracuda and several types of whale native to the cliffs of northern california are seals sea lions and many types of shorebirds including migratory species
as of april 2003 118 california animals were on the federal endangered list 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened endangered animals include the san joaquin kitfox point arena mountain beaver pacific pocket mouse salt marsh harvest mouse morro bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat) amargosa vole california least tern california condor loggerhead shrike san clemente sage sparrow san francisco garter snake five species of salamander three species of chub and two species of pupfish eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list among threatened animals are the coastal california gnatcatcher paiute cutthroat trout southern sea otter and northern spotted owl california has a total of 290,821 acres (1,176.91 km2) of national wildlife refuges as of september 2010 123 california animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the us fish & wildlife service also as of the same year 178 species of california plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list
=== rivers ===
the vast majority of rivers in california are dammed as part of two massive water projects the central valley project providing water to the agricultural central valley the california state water project diverting water from northern to southern california the state's coasts rivers and other bodies of water are regulated by the california coastal commission
the two most prominent rivers within california are the sacramento river and the san joaquin river which drain the central valley and the west slope of the sierra nevada and flow to the pacific ocean through san francisco bay several major tributaries feed into the sacramento and the san joaquin including the pit river the tuolumne river and the feather river
the eel river and salinas river each drain portions of the california coast north and south of san francisco bay respectively and the eel river is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state the mojave river is the primary watercourse in the mojave desert and the santa ana river drains much of the transverse ranges as it bisects southern california some other important rivers are the klamath river and the trinity river in the far north coast and the colorado river on the southeast border with arizona
=== regions ===
== history ==
=== pre-contact ===
settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-columbian north america various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000 which was about one-third of all native americans in what is now the united states the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource-rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the chumash pomo and salinan trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups
=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
the first european effort to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition led by portuguese captain juan rodrguez cabrillo in 1542 some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579 spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 1565 the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587 when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay sebastin vizcano explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain
after the portol expedition of 1769-70 spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta (upper) california beginning in san diego during the same period spanish military forces built several forts (presidios) and three small towns (pueblos) two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose
=== 19th century ===
imperial russia explored the california coast and established a trading post at fort ross its early 19th-century coastal settlements north of san francisco bay constituted the southernmost russian colony in north america and were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay
in 1821 the mexican war of independence gave mexico (including california) independence from spain for the next 25 years alta california remained a remote northern province of the nation of mexico
cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california after mexican independence from spain the chain of missions became the property of the mexican government and were secularized by 1834 the ranchos developed under ownership by californios (spanish-speaking californians) who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants
from the 1820s trappers and settlers from the u.s and canada arrived in northern california these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail california trail oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding california
between 1831 and 1836 california experienced a series of revolts against mexico this culminated in the 1836 california revolt led by juan bautista alvarado which ended after mexico appointed him governor of the department the revolt which had momentarily declared california an independent state was successful with the assistance of american and british residents of california including isaac graham after 1840 100 of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the graham affair in 1840
one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts he determined that california should become part of the united states marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the california climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as marsh's route. his letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to california he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports
after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california thereby paving the way to california's ultimate acquisition by the united states
in 1846 settlers rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt afterwards rebels raised the bear flag (featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words california republic") at sonoma the republic's only president was william b ide who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt
the california republic was short lived the same year marked the outbreak of the mexican-american war (18461848) when commodore john d sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states northern california capitulated in less than a month to the u.s forces after a series of defensive battles in southern california the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13 1847 securing american control in california
following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo that ended the war the western territory of alta california became the u.s state of california and arizona nevada colorado and utah became u.s territories the lightly populated lower region of california the baja peninsula remained in the possession of mexico
in 1846 the non-native population of california was estimated to be no more than 8,000 plus about 100,000 native americans down from about 300,000 before hispanic settlement in 1769 after gold was discovered the population burgeoned with u.s citizens europeans chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush by 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come between 1847 and 1870 the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 150,000 on september 9 1850 as part of the compromise of 1850 california was admitted to the united states undivided as a free state denying the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast
california's native population precipitously declined above all from eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity like in other states the native inhabitants were forcibly removed from their lands by incoming miners ranchers and farmers and although california entered the union as a free state the loitering or orphaned indians were de facto enslaved by mexican and anglo-american masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians there were massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed between 1850 and 1860 california paid around 1.5 million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government) to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations in later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them as a result the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants several scholars and native american activists including benjamin madley and ed castillo have described the actions of the california government as a genocide
the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule was located at monterey from 1777 until 1845 pio pico last mexican governor of alta california moved the capital to los angeles in 1845 the united states consulate was also located in monterey under consul thomas o larkin
in 1849 the constitutional convention was first held in monterey among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital the first legislative sessions were held in san jose (18501851) subsequent locations included vallejo (18521853) and nearby benicia (18531854) these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well the capital has been located in sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento
initially travel between california and the rest of the continental u.s was time consuming and dangerous a more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad through donner pass in the sierra nevada mountains once completed hundreds of thousands of u.s citizens came west where new californians were discovering that land in the state if irrigated during the dry summer months was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in southern california) and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere
=== 20th century ===
migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66 in the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the union in 1940 the census bureau reported california's population as 6.0% hispanic 2.4% asian and 89.5% non-hispanic white
to meet the population's needs major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts the oroville and shasta dams and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education
meanwhile attracted to the mild mediterranean climate cheap land and the state's wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s california manufactured 8.7 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking third (behind new york and michigan) among the 48 states after world war ii california's economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries whose size decreased following the end of the cold war stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as silicon valley as a result of these efforts california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the u.s center of agricultural production just before the dot com bust california had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in southern california california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus
however during the 20th century two great disasters happened in california the 1906 san francisco earthquake and 1928 st francis dam flood remain the deadliest in u.s history
== demographics ==
=== population ===
the united states census bureau estimates that the population of california was 38,802,500 on july 1 2014 a 4.16% increase since the 2010 united states census between 2000 and 2009 there was a natural increase of 3,090,016 (5,058,440 births minus 2,179,958 deaths) during this time period international migration produced a net increase of 1,816,633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1,509,708 resulting in a net in-migration of 306,925 people the state of california's own statistics show a population of 38,292,687 for january 1 2009 however according to the manhattan institute for policy research since 1990 almost 3.4 million californians have moved to other states with most leaving to texas nevada and arizona
california is the second-most-populous sub-national entity in the western hemisphere and the americas with a population second to that of state of so paulo brazil california's population is greater than that of all but 34 countries of the world also los angeles county has held the title of most populous u.s county for decades and it alone is more populous than 42 u.s states in addition california is home to eight of the 50 most populous cities in the united states los angeles (2nd) san diego (8th) san jose (10th) san francisco (13th) fresno (34th) sacramento (35th) long beach (36th) and oakland (47th) the center of population of california is located in the town of buttonwillow kern county
==== immigration ====
starting in the year 2010 for the first time since the california gold rush california-born residents make up the majority of the state's population along with the rest of the u.s. california's immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s-early 2010s immigration from latin american countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from asia in total for 2011 there were 277,304 immigrants 57% came from asian countries vs 22% from latin american countries net immigration from mexico previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zero/less than zero since more mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating as a result it is estimated that hispanics citizens will constitute 49% of the population by 2060 instead of the previously projected 2050 due primarily to domestic births
===== illegal immigration =====
the state's population of illegal immigrants has been shrinking in recent years due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for low-skill workers the number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the mexican border in the southwest plunged from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to just 367,000 in 2011 despite these recent trends illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state's population the third highest percentage of any state in the country totaling nearly 2.6 million in partciular illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in los angeles monterey san benito imperial and napa counties the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor more than half of illegal immigrants originate from mexico
=== racial and ancestral makeup ===
according to the u.s census bureau during the 2010 census the population is (alone or in combination)
61.6% white (22,953,374)(57.6% single-race white)
14.9% asian (5,556,592)(13.0% single-race asian)(filipino 1,474,707 chinese 1,349,111 vietnamese 647,589 indian 590,445 korean 505,225 japanese 428,014 taiwanese 109,928 cambodian 102,317)
7.2% black or african american (2,684,914)(6.2% single-race black or african american)
1.9% native american and alaska native (723,225)(1.0% single-race native american and alaska native)(cherokee 92,246 mexican american 66,424 apache 24,799 choctaw 23,403 navajo 17,080)
0.8% native hawaiian or pacific islander (286,145)(0.4% single-race native hawaiian or pacific islander)(hawaiian 74,932 samoan 60,876 chamorro 44,425)
37.6% are hispanic or latino (of any race) (14,013,719) (19.3% white hispanic or latino 0.9% asian hispanic or latino 0.7% black hispanic or latino 0.9% native american hispanic or latino 0.1% native hawaiian or pacific islander hispanic or latino)
in terms of total numbers california has the largest population of white americans in the u.s. an estimated 22,200,000 residents the state has the 5th largest population of african americans in the u.s. an estimated 2,250,000 residents california's asian american population is estimated at 4.4 million constituting a third of the nation's total california's native american population of 285,000 is the most of any state
according to estimates from 2011 california has the largest minority population in the united states by numbers making up 60% of the state population over the past 25 years the population of non-hispanic whites has declined while hispanic and asian populations have grown between 1970 and 2011 non-hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state's population to 40% while hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011 it is currently projected that hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060 primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration with the decline of immigration from latin america asian americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in california this growth primarily driven by immigration from china india and the philippines respectively
=== languages ===
english serves as california's de jure and de facto official language in 2010 the modern language association of america estimated that 57.02% (19,429,309) of california residents age 5 and older spoke only english at home while 42.98% spoke another primary language at home according to the 2007 american community survey 73% of people who speak a language other than english at home are able to speak english well or very well with 9.8% not speaking english at all unlike most u.s states california law enshrines english as its official language (rather than it being simply the most commonly used) since the passage of proposition 63 by california voters additionally proposition 227 requires instruction in public schools take place in english yet various government agencies do and are often required to furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences
in total 16 languages other than english were spoken as primary languages at home by more than 100,000 persons more than any other state in the nation new york state in second place had 9 languages other than english spoken by more than 100,000 persons the most common language spoken besides english was spanish spoken by 28.46% (9,696,638) of the population as the primary driver of the hispanic population is domestic births however it is estimated the spanish language use will peak and then decline over the course of the coming decades with asia contributing most of california's new immigrants california had the highest concentration nationwide of vietnamese and chinese speakers the second highest concentration of korean and the third highest concentration of tagalog speakers
california has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families a survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages of mexico that are spoken among california farmworkers all of california's indigenous languages are endangered although there are now efforts toward language revitalization
as a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken english in california since the late 20th century this dialect known as california english has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from the dialects used in other regions of the country
=== armed forces ===
in california as of 2009 the u.s department of defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were sailors or marines 18,339 were airmen and 11,097 were soldiers with 61,365 department of defense civilian employees additionally there were a total of 57,792 reservists and guardsman in california
