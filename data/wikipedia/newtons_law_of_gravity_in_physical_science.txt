newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that together laid the foundation for classical mechanics they describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it and its motion in response to those forces they have been expressed in several different ways over nearly three centuries and can be summarised as follows
the three laws of motion were first compiled by isaac newton in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica (mathematical principles of natural philosophy) first published in 1687 newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems for example in the third volume of the text newton showed that these laws of motion combined with his law of universal gravitation explained kepler's laws of planetary motion
== overviewedit ==
newton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily this can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis or the deformation and rotation of the body are of no importance in this way even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star
in their original form newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of rigid bodies and deformable bodies leonhard euler in 1750 introduced a generalisation of newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called euler's laws of motion later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a continuum if a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles each governed by newton's laws of motion then euler's laws can be derived from newton's laws euler's laws can however be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies independently of any particle structure
newton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of frames of reference called newtonian or inertial reference frames some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view the second law only holds when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second the explicit concept of an inertial frame of reference was not developed until long after newton's death
in the given interpretation mass acceleration momentum and (most importantly) force are assumed to be externally defined quantities this is the most common but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities
newtonian mechanics has been superseded by special relativity but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the speed of light
== newton's first lawedit ==
the first law states that if the net force (the vector sum of all forces acting on an object) is zero then the velocity of the object is constant velocity is a vector quantity which expresses both the object's speed and the direction of its motion; therefore the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant
the first law can be stated mathematically as
consequently
an object that is at rest will stay at rest unless an external force acts upon it
an object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless an external force acts upon it
this is known as uniform motion an object continues to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it if it is at rest it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest) if an object is moving it continues to move without turning or changing its speed this is evident in space probes that continually move in outer space changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion in the absence of net forces a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely
newton placed the first law of motion to establish frames of reference for which the other laws are applicable the first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one frame of reference called a newtonian or inertial reference frame relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed newton's first law is often referred to as the law of inertia thus a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net force acting on it is zero in this sense the first law can be restated as:
in every material universe the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in  that is a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it
newton's laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame i.e galilean invariance or the principle of newtonian relativity
== newton's second lawedit ==
the second law states that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change (that is the derivative) of its linear momentum p in an inertial reference frame:
the second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration since newton's second law is only valid for constant-mass systems mass can be taken outside the differentiation operator by the constant factor rule in differentiation thus
where f is the net force applied m is the mass of the body and a is the body's acceleration thus the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration in other words if a body is accelerating then there is a force on it
consistent with the first law the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with uniform circular motion the relationship also implies the conservation of momentum: when the net force on the body is zero the momentum of the body is constant any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum
any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force a different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see below)
newton's second law requires modification if the effects of special relativity are to be taken into account because at high speeds the approximation that momentum is the product of rest mass and velocity is not accurate
=== impulseedit ===
an impulse j occurs when a force f acts over an interval of time t and it is given by
since force is the time derivative of momentum it follows that
this relation between impulse and momentum is closer to newton's wording of the second law
impulse is a concept frequently used in the analysis of collisions and impacts
=== variable-mass systemsedit ===
variable-mass systems like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases are not closed and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law; that is the following formula is wrong:
the falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect galilean invariance: a variable-mass object with f = 0 in one frame will be seen to have f 0 in another frame the correct equation of motion for a body whose mass m varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is
where u is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body from this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system for example the tsiolkovsky rocket equation under some conventions the quantity udm/dt on the left-hand side which represents the advection of momentum is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity f then by substituting the definition of acceleration the equation becomes f = ma
== newton's third lawedit ==
the third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object a exerts a force fa on a second object b then b simultaneously exerts a force fb on a and the two forces are equal and opposite: fa = fb the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body this law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law with fa called the "action" and fb the "reaction" the action and the reaction are simultaneous and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part of a single interaction and neither force exists without the other
the two forces in newton's third law are of the same type (e.g. if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires then it is also a frictional force that newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road)
from a conceptual standpoint newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor and the floor pushes against the person similarly the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tiresthe tires and road simultaneously push against each other in swimming a person interacts with the water pushing the water backward while the water simultaneously pushes the person forwardboth the person and the water push against each other the reaction forces account for the motion in these examples these forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice for example may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force

=== newton's 1st lawedit ===
from the original latin of newton's principia:
translated to english this reads:
the ancient greek philosopher aristotle had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens he thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it otherwise it would stop moving galileo galilei however realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body i.e. acceleration but no force is needed to maintain its velocity in other words galileo stated that in the absence of a force a moving object will continue moving the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what galileo called inertia this insight was refined by newton who made it into his first law also known as the "law of inertia"no force means no acceleration and hence the body will maintain its velocity as newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which galileo had already described newton appropriately gave credit to galileo
the law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently including thomas hobbes in his leviathan the 17th century philosopher and mathematician ren descartes also formulated the law although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it
=== newton's 2nd lawedit ===
newton's original latin reads:
this was translated quite closely in motte's 1729 translation as:
according to modern ideas of how newton was using his terminology this is understood in modern terms as an equivalent of:
the change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed
this may be expressed by the formula f = p' where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p this equation can be seen clearly in the wren library of trinity college cambridge in a glass case in which newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page
motte's 1729 translation of newton's latin continued with newton's commentary on the second law of motion reading:
if a force generates a motion a double force will generate double the motion a triple force triple the motion whether that force be impressed altogether and at once or gradually and successively and this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force) if the body moved before is added to or subtracted from the former motion according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined when they are oblique so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both
the sense or senses in which newton used his terminology and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood have been extensively discussed by historians of science along with the relations between newton's formulation and modern formulations
=== newton's 3rd lawedit ===
translated to english this reads:
newton's scholium (explanatory comment) to this law:
whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other if you press a stone with your finger the finger is also pressed by the stone if a horse draws a stone tied to a rope the horse (if i may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself will draw the horse as much towards the stone as it does the stone towards the horse and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other if a body impinges upon another and by its force changes the motion of the other that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change in its own motion toward the contrary part the changes made by these actions are equal not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments for as the motions are equally changed the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies this law takes place also in attractions as will be proved in the next scholium
in the above as usual motion is newton's name for momentum hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity
newton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum; from a deeper perspective however conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via noether's theorem from galilean invariance) and holds in cases where newton's third law appears to fail for instance when force fields as well as particles carry momentum and in quantum mechanics
== importance and range of validityedit ==
newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life newton's laws of motion together with his law of universal gravitation and the mathematical techniques of calculus provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena
these three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions however newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and classical electrodynamics) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances most notably at very small scales very high speeds (in special relativity the lorentz factor must be included in the expression for momentum along with rest mass and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields therefore the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a semiconductor optical properties of substances errors in non-relativistically corrected gps systems and superconductivity explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories including general relativity and quantum field theory
in quantum mechanics concepts such as force momentum and position are defined by linear operators that operate on the quantum state; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects at speeds comparable to the speed of light the second law holds in the original form f = dp/dt where f and p are four-vectors
== relationship to the conservation lawsedit ==
in modern physics the laws of conservation of momentum energy and angular momentum are of more general validity than newton's laws since they apply to both light and matter and to both classical and non-classical physics
this can be stated simply "momentum energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed."
because force is the time derivative of momentum the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g. quantum mechanics quantum electrodynamics general relativity etc.) the standard model explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as gauge forces originate out of exchange by virtual particles other forces such as gravity and fermionic degeneracy pressure also arise from the momentum conservation indeed the conservation of 4-momentum in inertial motion via curved space-time results in what we call gravitational force in general relativity theory application of space derivative (which is a momentum operator in quantum mechanics) to overlapping wave functions of pair of fermions (particles with half-integer spin) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other which is observable as "repulsion" of fermions
newton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles however he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this action at a distance and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase "i feign no hypotheses" in modern physics action at a distance has been completely eliminated except for subtle effects involving quantum entanglement however in modern engineering in all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites the concept of action at a distance is used extensively
the discovery of the second law of thermodynamics by carnot in the 19th century showed that every physical quantity is not conserved over time thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from newton's laws hence a "steady-state" worldview based solely on newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take entropy into account
