dicyanoacetylene also called carbon subnitride or but-2-ynedinitrile (iupac) is a compound of carbon and nitrogen with chemical formula c4n2 it has a linear molecular structure nccccn (often abbreviated as nc4n) with alternating triple and single covalent bonds it can be viewed as acetylene with the two hydrogen atoms replaced by cyanide groups
at room temperature dicyanoacetylene is a clear liquid because of its high endothermic heat of formation it can explode to carbon powder and nitrogen gas and it burns in oxygen with a bright blue-white flame at a temperature of 5260 k (4990 c 9010 f) which is the hottest flame of any chemical reaction
== synthesisedit ==
dicyanoacetylene can be prepared by passing nitrogen gas over a sample of graphite heated to temperatures between 2673 to 3000 k
== as a reagent in organic chemistryedit ==
dicyanoacetylene is a powerful dienophile because the cyanide groups are electron-withdrawing so it is a useful reagent for diels-alder reactions with unreactive dienes it even adds to the aromatic compound durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) to form a substituted bicyclooctatriene only the most reactive of dienophiles can attack such aromatic compounds
== in outer spaceedit ==
solid dicyanoacetylene has been detected in the atmosphere of titan by infrared spectroscopy as the seasons change on titan the compound condenses and evaporates in a cycle which allows scientists on earth to study titanian meteorology
as of 2006 the detection of dicyanoacetylene in the interstellar medium has been impossible because its symmetry means it has no rotational microwave spectrum however similar asymmetric molecules like cyanoacetylene have been observed and its presence in those environments is therefore suspected
