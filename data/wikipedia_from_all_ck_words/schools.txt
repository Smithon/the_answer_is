a school is an institution designed for the teaching of students (or pupils") under the direction of teachers most countries have systems of formal education which is commonly compulsory in these systems students progress through a series of schools the names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education an institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university
in addition to these core schools students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary and secondary education kindergarten or pre-school provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 35) university vocational school college or seminary may be available after secondary school a school may also be dedicated to one particular field such as a school of economics or a school of dance alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods
there are also non-government schools called private schools private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate or special education other private schools can also be religious such as christian schools hawzas yeshivas and others or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements schools for adults include institutions of corporate training military education and training and business schools
in homeschooling and online schools teaching and learning take place outside of a traditional school building
== etymology ==
the word school derives from greek (schol) originally meaning leisure and also that in which leisure is employed but later a group to whom lectures were given school
== history and development ==
the concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since classical antiquity formal schools have existed at least since ancient greece (see academy) ancient rome (see education in ancient rome) ancient india (see gurukul) and ancient china (see history of education in china) the byzantine empire had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level according to traditions and encounters the founding of the primary education system began in 425 ad and  military personnel usually had at least a primary education  the sometimes efficient and often large government of the empire meant that educated citizens were a must although byzantium lost much of the grandeur of roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving the empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals the byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 ad
islam was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word emphasis was put on knowledge which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge and purpose-built structures at first mosques combined both religious performance and learning activities but by the 9th century the madrassa was introduced a proper school that was built independently from the mosque they were also the first to make the madrassa system a public domain under the control of the caliph the nizamiyya madrasa is considered by consensus of scholars to be the earliest surviving school built towards 1066 ad by emir nizam al-mulk
under the ottomans the towns of bursa and edirne became the main centers of learning the ottoman system of klliye a building complex containing a mosque a hospital madrassa and public kitchen and dining areas revolutionized the education system making learning accessible to a wider public through its free meals health care and sometimes free accommodation
the 19th century historian scott holds that a remarkable correspondence exists between the procedure established by those institutions and the methods of the present day they had their collegiate courses their prizes for proficiency in scholarship their oratorical and poetical contests their commencements and their degrees in the department of medicine a severe and prolonged examination conducted by the most eminent physicians of the capital was exacted of all candidates desirous of practicing their profession and such as were unable to stand the test were formally pronounced incompetent
in europe universities emerged during the 12th century here scholasticism was an important tool and the academicians were called schoolmen during the middle ages and much of the early modern period the main purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the latin language this led to the term grammar school which in the united states informally refers to a primary school but in the united kingdom means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude following this the school curriculum has gradually broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language as well as technical artistic scientific and practical subjects
obligatory school attendance became common in parts of europe during the 18th century in denmark-norway this was introduced as early as in 1739-1741 the primary end being to increase the literacy of the almue i.e the regular people many of the earlier public schools in the united states and elsewhere were one-room schools where a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom beginning in the 1920s one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with transportation increasingly provided by kid hacks and school buses

some schools offer remote access to their classes over the internet online schools also can provide support to traditional schools as in the case of the school net namibia some online classes also provide experience in a class so that when people take them they have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect and even more classes provide high school/college credit allowing people to take the classes at their own pace many online classes cost money to take but some are offered free
internet-based distance learning programs are offered widely through many universities instructors teach through online activities and assignments online classes are taught the same as physically being in class with the same curriculum the instructor offers the syllabus with their fixed requirements like any other class students can virtually turn their assignments in to their instructors according to deadlines this being through via email or in the course webpage this allowing students to work at their own pace yet meeting the correct deadline students taking an online class have more flexibility in their schedules to take their classes at a time that works best for them conflicts with taking an online class may include not being face to face with the instructor when learning or being in an environment with other students online classes can also make understanding the content difficult especially when not able to get in quick contact with the instructor online students do have the advantage of using other online sources with assignments or exams for that specific class online classes also have the advantage of students not needing to leave their house for a morning class or worrying about their attendance for that class students can work at their own pace to learn and achieve within that curriculum

== discipline ==
schools and their teachers have always been under pressure for instance pressure to cover the curriculum to perform well in comparison to other schools and to avoid the stigma of being soft or spoiling toward students forms of discipline such as control over when students may speak and normalized behaviour such as raising a hand to speak are imposed in the name of greater efficiency practitioners of critical pedagogy maintain that such disciplinary measures have no positive effect on student learning indeed some argue that disciplinary practices detract from learning saying that they undermine students individual dignity and sense of self-worththe latter occupying a more primary role in students hierarchy of needs
