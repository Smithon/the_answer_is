== what type of thing is chemistry ==
chemistry can be described as all of the following:
an academic discipline one with academic departments curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals
a scientific field (a branch of science) widely-recognized category of specialized expertise within science and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals where peer reviewed research is published there are several geophysics-related scientific journals
a natural science one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific method
a physical science one that studies non-living systems
a biological science one that studies the role of chemicals and chemical processes in living organisms see outline of biochemistry
