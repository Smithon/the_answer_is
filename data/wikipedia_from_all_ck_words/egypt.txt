== history ==
=== prehistory and ancient egypt ===
there is evidence of rock carvings along the nile terraces and in desert oases in the 10th millennium bc a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 bc began to desiccate the pastoral lands of egypt forming the sahara early tribal peoples migrated to the nile river where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society
by about 6000 bc a neolithic culture rooted in the nile valley during the neolithic era several predynastic cultures developed independently in upper and lower egypt the badarian culture and the successor naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic egypt the earliest known lower egyptian site merimda predates the badarian by about seven hundred years contemporaneous lower egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years remaining culturally distinct but maintaining frequent contact through trade the earliest known evidence of egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on naqada iii pottery vessels dated to about 3200 bc
a unified kingdom was founded c 3150 bc by king menes leading to a series of dynasties that ruled egypt for the next three millennia egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively egyptian in its religion arts language and customs the first two ruling dynasties of a unified egypt set the stage for the old kingdom period c 27002200 bc. which constructed many pyramids most notably the third dynasty pyramid of djoser and the fourth dynasty giza pyramids
the first intermediate period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years stronger nile floods and stabilisation of government however brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the middle kingdom c 2040 bc reaching a peak during the reign of pharaoh amenemhat iii a second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in egypt that of the semitic hyksos the hyksos invaders took over much of lower egypt around 1650 bc and founded a new capital at avaris they were driven out by an upper egyptian force led by ahmose i who founded the eighteenth dynasty and relocated the capital from memphis to thebes
the new kingdom c 15501070 bc began with the eighteenth dynasty marking the rise of egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as tombos in nubia and included parts of the levant in the east this period is noted for some of the most well known pharaohs including hatshepsut thutmose iii akhenaten and his wife nefertiti tutankhamun and ramesses ii the first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as atenism frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the new kingdom the country was later invaded and conquered by libyans nubians and assyrians but native egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country
in 525 bc the powerful achaemenid persians led by cambyses ii began their conquest of egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh psamtik iii at the battle of pelusium cambyses ii then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled egypt from his home of susa in persia (modern iran) leaving egypt under the control of a satrapy the entire twenty-seventh dynasty of egypt from 525 bc to 402 bc save for petubastis iii was an entirely persian ruled period with the achaemenid kings all being granted the title of pharaoh a few temporarily successful revolts against the persians marked the fifth century bc but egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the persians
the thirtieth dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the pharaonic epoch it fell to the persians again in 343 bc after the last native pharaoh king nectanebo ii was defeated in battle this thirty-first dynasty of egypt however did not last long for the persians were toppled several decades later by alexander the great
=== ptolemaic and roman egypt ===
the ptolemaic kingdom was a powerful hellenistic state extending from southern syria in the east to cyrene to the west and south to the frontier with nubia alexandria became the capital city and a centre of greek culture and trade to gain recognition by the native egyptian populace they named themselves as the successors to the pharaohs the later ptolemies took on egyptian traditions had themselves portrayed on public monuments in egyptian style and dress and participated in egyptian religious life
the last ruler from the ptolemaic line was cleopatra vii who committed suicide following the burial of her lover mark antony who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound) after octavian had captured alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled the ptolemies faced rebellions of native egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by rome nevertheless hellenistic culture continued to thrive in egypt well after the muslim conquest
christianity was brought to egypt by saint mark the evangelist in the 1st century diocletian's reign (from 284 to 305 ad) marked the transition from the roman to the byzantine era in egypt when a great number of egyptian christians were persecuted the new testament had by then been translated into egyptian after the council of chalcedon in ad 451 a distinct egyptian coptic church was firmly established
=== middle ages (7th century-1517) ===
the byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief sasanian persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the byzantinesasanian war of 602628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as sasanian egypt until 63942 when egypt was invaded and conquered by the islamic empire by the muslim arabs when they defeated the byzantine armies in egypt the arabs brought sunni islam to the country early in this period egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices leading to various sufi orders that have flourished to this day these earlier rites had survived the period of coptic christianity
=== during muhammad's era ===
the islamic prophet muhammad's first interaction with the people of egypt was during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha (hisma) he sent hatib bin abi baltaeh with a letter to the king of egypt called muqawqis in the letter muhammad said i invite you to accept islam allah the sublime shall reward you doubly but if you refuse to do so you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the copts during this expedition one of muhammad's envoys dihyah bin khalifa kalbi was attacked muhammad sent zayd ibn haritha to help him
dihya approached the banu dubayb (a tribe which converted to islam and had good relations with muslims) for help when the news reached muhammad he immediately dispatched zayd ibn haritha with 500 men to punish them the muslim army fought with banu judham killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties) including their chief al-hunayd ibn arid and his son and captured 1000 camels 5000 of their cattle and a 100 women and boys the new chief of the banu judham who had embraced islam appealed to muhammad to release his fellow tribesmean and muhammad released them
=== islamic era ===
muslim rulers nominated by the islamic caliphate remained in control of egypt for the next six centuries with cairo as the seat of the caliphate under the fatimids with the end of the kurdish ayyubid dynasty the mamluks a turco-circassian military caste took control about ad 1250 by the late 13th century egypt linked the red sea india malaya and east indies the mid-14th-century black death killed about 40% of the country's population hatib bin abi baltaeh to the king of egypt called muqawqis to invite him to islam
=== ottoman egypt (15171867) ===
egypt was conquered by the ottoman turks in 1517 after which it became a province of the ottoman empire the defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions the weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion portuguese traders took over their trade between 1687 and 1731 egypt experienced six famines the 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population
egypt was always a difficult province for the ottoman sultans to control due in part to the continuing power and influence of the mamluks the egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries
egypt remained semi-autonomous under the mamluks until it was invaded by the french forces of napoleon i in 1798 (see french campaign in egypt and syria) after the french were defeated by the british a power vacuum was created in egypt and a three-way power struggle ensued between the ottoman turks egyptian mamluks who had ruled egypt for centuries and albanian mercenaries in the service of the ottomans
=== founding of the muhammad ali dynasty ===
after the french were expelled power was seized in 1805 by muhammad ali pasha an albanian military commander of the ottoman army in egypt while he carried the title of viceroy of egypt his subordination to the ottoman porte was merely nominal muhammad ali established a dynasty that was to rule egypt until the revolution of 1952
the introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture before the end of the century concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets
muhammad ali annexed northern sudan (18201824) syria (1833) and parts of arabia and anatolia but in 1841 the european powers fearful lest he topple the ottoman empire itself forced him to return most of his conquests to the ottomans his military ambition required him to modernise the country he built industries a system of canals for irrigation and transport and reformed the civil service
muhammad ali pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corve to a great modernised army he introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century egypt and took a novel approach to create his great army strengthening it with numbers and in skill education and training of the new soldiers was not an option the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation the men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with the resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold one of nationalism and pride it was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that muhammad ali imposed his rule over egypt
muhammad ali was succeeded briefly by his son ibrahim (in september 1848) then by a grandson abbas i (in november 1848) then by said (in 1854) and isma'il (in 1863)
=== end of ottoman egypt and the european intrusion (18671914) ===
egypt under the muhammad ali dynasty remained nominally an ottoman province it was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or khedivate in 1867 a status which was to remain in place until 1914
the suez canal built in partnership with the french was completed in 1869 its construction led to enormous debt to european banks and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required in 1875 ismail was forced to sell egypt's share in the canal to the british government within three years this led to the imposition of british and french controllers who sat in the egyptian cabinet and with the financial power of the bondholders behind them were the real power in the government.
in later years the dynasty became a british puppet isma'il and tewfik pasha governed egypt as a quasi-independent state under ottoman suzerainty until the british occupation of 1882
local dissatisfaction with ismail and with european intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879 with ahmad urabi a prominent figure fearing a reduction of their control the uk and france intervened militarily bombarding alexandria and crushing the egyptian army at the battle of tel el-kebir they reinstalled ismail's son tewfik as figurehead of a de facto british protectorate
in 1906 the dinshaway incident prompted many neutral egyptians to join the nationalist movement
=== british protectorate ===
the khedivate of egypt remained a de jure ottoman province until 5 november 1914 when it was declared a british protectorate in reaction to the decision of the young turks of the ottoman empire to join world war i on the side of the central powers
in 1914 the protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state was changed to sultan to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the ottoman sultan who was backing the central powers in world war i abbas ii was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle hussein kamel as sultan
after world war i saad zaghlul and the wafd party led the egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local legislative assembly when the british exiled zaghlul and his associates to malta on 8 march 1919 the country arose in its first modern revolution the revolt led the uk government to issue a unilateral declaration of egypt's independence on 22 february 1922
the new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system saad zaghlul was popularly elected as prime minister of egypt in 1924 in 1936 the anglo-egyptian treaty was concluded continued instability due to remaining british influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'tat known as the 1952 revolution the free officers movement forced king farouk to abdicate in support of his son fuad british military presence in egypt lasted until 1954
=== republic (1953) ===
following the 1952 revolution by the free officers movement the rule of egypt passed to military hands on 18 june 1953 the egyptian republic was declared with general muhammad naguib as the first president of the republic
==== reign of president nasser (1956-1970) ====
naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by gamal abdel nasser the real architect of the 1952 movement and was later put under house arrest nasser assumed power as president in june 1956 british forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied suez canal zone on 13 june 1956 he nationalised the suez canal on 26 july 1956 prompting the 1956 suez crisis
in 1958 egypt and syria formed a sovereign union known as the united arab republic the union was short-lived ending in 1961 when syria seceded thus ending the union during most of its existence the united arab republic was also in a loose confederation with north yemen (or the mutawakkilite kingdom of yemen) known as the united arab states in 1959 the all-palestine government of the gaza strip an egyptian client state was absorbed into the united arab republic under the pretext of arab union and was never restored
in early 1960s egypt became fully involved in the north yemen civil war the egyptian president gamal abdel nasser supported the yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 egyptian troops and chemical weapons despite several military moves and peace conferences the war sank into a stalemate egyptian commitment in yemen was greatly undermined later
in mid may 1967 the soviet union issued warnings to nasser of an impending israeli attack on syria although the chief of staff mohamed fawzi verified them as baseless nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable on 14 may he deployed his troops in sinai near the border with israel on 19 may he expelled the un peacekeepers stationed in the sinai peninsula border with israel and on 23 may he closed the straits of tiran to israeli shipping on 26 may nasser declared the battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy israel
israel re-iterated that the straits of tiran closure was a casus belli in the 1967 six day war israel attacked egypt and occupied sinai peninsula and the gaza strip which egypt had occupied since the 1948 arabisraeli war during the 1967 war an emergency law was enacted and remained in effect until 2012 with the exception of an 18-month break in 1980/81 under this law police powers were extended constitutional rights suspended and censorship legalised
at the time of the fall of the egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s less than half a million egyptians were considered upper class and rich four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school most of them being boys nasser's policies changed this land reform and distribution the dramatic growth in university education and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve from academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 overall public school enrolments more than doubled millions of previously poor egyptians through education and jobs in the public sector joined the middle class doctors engineers teachers lawyers journalists constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in egypt under nasser during the 1960s the egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse the society became less free and nasser's appeal waned considerably
==== reign of president sadat (1970-1981) ====
in 1970 president nasser died and was succeeded by anwar sadat sadat switched egypt's cold war allegiance from the soviet union to the united states expelling soviet advisors in 1972 he launched the infitah economic reform policy while clamping down on religious and secular opposition in 1973 egypt along with syria launched the october war a surprise attack to regain part of the sinai territory israel had captured 6 years earlier it presented sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the sinai later in return for peace with israel
in 1975 sadat shifted nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of infitah through this policy incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction abandoning egypt's infant industries even though sadat's policy was intended to modernise egypt and assist the middle class it mainly benefited the higher class and because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs led to the 1977 egyptian bread riots
sadat made a historic visit to israel in 1977 which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for israeli withdrawal from sinai sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the arab world and led to egypt's expulsion from the arab league but it was supported by most egyptians sadat was assassinated by an islamic extremist in october 1981
==== reign of president mubarak (19812011) ====
hosni mubarak came to power after the assassination of sadat in a referendum in which he was the only candidate
hosni mubarak reaffirmed egypt's relationship with israel yet eased the tensions with egypt's arab neighbours domestically mubarak faced serious problems even though farm and industry output expanded the economy could not keep pace with the population boom mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like cairo where they ended up in crowded slums barely managing to survive
in the 1980s 1990s and 2000s terrorist attacks in egypt became numerous and severe and began to target christian copts foreign tourists and government officials in the 1990s an islamist group al-gama'a al-islamiyya engaged in an extended campaign of violence from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners serious damage was done to the largest sector of egypt's economytourismand in turn to the government but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support
during mubarak's reign the political scene was dominated by the national democratic party which was created by sadat in 1978 it passed the 1993 syndicates law 1995 press law and 1999 nongovernmental associations law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations as a result by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well
on 17 november 1997 62 people mostly tourists were massacred near luxor in late february 2005 mubarak announced a reform of the presidential election law paving the way for multi-candidate polls for the first time since the 1952 movement however the new law placed restrictions on the candidates and led to mubarak's easy re-election victory voter turnout was less than 25% election observers also alleged government interference in the election process after the election mubarak imprisoned ayman nour the runner-up
human rights watch's 2006 report on egypt detailed serious human rights violations including routine torture arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts in 2007 amnesty international released a report alleging that egypt had become an international centre for torture where other nations send suspects for interrogation often as part of the war on terror egypt's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report
constitutional changes voted on 19 march 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring in 2009 dr ali el deen hilal dessouki media secretary of the national democratic party (ndp) described egypt as a pharaonic political system and democracy as a long-term goal dessouki also stated that the real center of power in egypt is the military
=== revolution ===
on 25 january 2011 widespread protests began against mubarak's government on 11 february 2011 mubarak resigned and fled cairo jubilant celebrations broke out in cairo's tahrir square at the news the egyptian military then assumed the power to govern mohamed hussein tantawi chairman of the supreme council of the armed forces became the de facto interim head of state on 13 february 2011 the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution
a constitutional referendum was held on 19 march 2011 on 28 november 2011 egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power turnout was high and there were no reports of major irregularities or violence mohamed morsi was elected president on 24 june 2012 on 2 august 2012 egypt's prime minister hisham qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the muslim brotherhood
liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict islamic practices while muslim brotherhood backers threw their support behind morsi on 22 november 2012 president morsi issued a temporary declaration immunising his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly
the move led to massive protests and violent action throughout egypt on 5 december 2012 tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of president morsi clashed in what was described as the largest violent battle between islamists and their foes since the country's revolution mohamed morsi offered a national dialogue with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the december 2012 constitutional referendum
=== coup d'tat ===
on 3 july 2013 the military removed president morsi from power in a coup d'tat and installed an interim government the move came 3 days after mass protests were organised across egypt for and against morsi's rule
on 4 july 2013 68-year-old chief justice of the supreme constitutional court of egypt adly mansour was sworn in as acting president over the new government following the removal of morsi the military-backed egyptian authorities cracked down on the muslim brotherhood and its supporters jailing thousands and killing hundreds of street protesters many of the muslim brotherhood leaders and activists have either been sentenced to death or life imprisonment in a series of mass trials
on 18 january 2014 the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1% of voters were supportive participation was low with only 38.6% of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33% who voted in a referendum during morsi's tenure on 26 march 2014 abdel fattah el-sisi the head of the egyptian armed forces who at this time was in control of the country resigned from the military announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election the poll held between 26 and 28 may 2014 resulted in a landslide victory for el-sisi sisi sworn into office as president of egypt on 8 june 2014 the muslim brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day the 46% turnout was lower than the 52% turnout in the 2012 election
== geography ==
egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22 and 32n and longitudes 25 and 35e at 1,001,450 square kilometres (386,660 sq mi) it is the world's 30th-largest country due to the extreme aridity of egypt's climate population centres are concentrated along the narrow nile valley and delta meaning that about 99% of the population uses about 5.5% of the total land area 98% of egyptians live on 3% of the territory
egypt is bordered by libya to the west the sudan to the south and the gaza strip and israel to the east egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position a transcontinental nation it possesses a land bridge (the isthmus of suez) between africa and asia traversed by a navigable waterway (the suez canal) that connects the mediterranean sea with the indian ocean by way of the red sea
apart from the nile valley the majority of egypt's landscape is desert with a few oases scattered about winds create prolific sand dunes that peak at more than 100 feet (30 m) high egypt includes parts of the sahara desert and of the libyan desert these deserts protected the kingdom of the pharaohs from western threats and were referred to as the red land in ancient egypt
towns and cities include alexandria the second largest city aswan asyut cairo the modern egyptian capital and largest city el-mahalla el-kubra giza the site of the pyramid of khufu hurghada luxor kom ombo port safaga port said sharm el sheikh suez where the south end of the suez canal is located zagazig and al-minya oases include bahariya el dakhla farafra el kharga and siwa protectorates include ras mohamed national park zaranik protectorate and siwa
on 13 march 2015 plans for a proposed new capital of egypt were announced
=== climate ===
most of egypt's rain falls in the winter months south of cairo rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year and at intervals of many years on a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm (16.1 in) mostly between october and march snow falls on sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as damietta baltim sidi barrany etc and rarely in alexandria a very small amount of snow fell on cairo on 13 december 2013 the first time cairo received snowfall in many decades frost is also known in mid-sinai and mid-egypt egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world and most of its land surface is desert
egypt has an unusually hot sunny and dry climate average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer the cooler mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast which helps to get more moderated temperatures especially at the height of the summertime the khamaseen is a hot dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer
it bringing scorching sand and dust particles and usually brings daytime temperatures over 40 c (104 f) and sometimes over 50 c (122 f) more in the interior while the relative humidity can drop to 5% or even less the absolute highest temperatures in egypt occur when the khamaseen blows the weather is always sunny and clear in egypt especially in cities such as aswan luxor sohag and asyut in fact this is one of the least cloudy and the least rainy regions on earth
prior to the construction of the aswan dam the nile flooded annually (colloquially the gift of the nile) replenishing egypt's soil this gave egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years
the potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten egypt's densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country's economy agriculture and industry combined with growing demographic pressures a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the 21st century according to some climate experts
=== biodiversity ===
egypt signed the rio convention on biological diversity on 9 june 1992 and became a party to the convention on 2 june 1994 it has subsequently produced a national biodiversity strategy and action plan which was received by the convention on 31 july 1998 where many cbd national biodiversity strategy and action plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants egypt's plan was unusual in providing balanced information about all forms of life
the plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from egypt algae (1483 species) animals (about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects) fungi (more than 627 species) monera (319 species) plants (2426 species) protozoans (371 species) for some major groups for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms the number was not known apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians birds fish mammals and reptiles the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from egypt for the fungi including lichen-forming species for example subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from egypt and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher
== government ==
the house of representatives whose members are elected to serve five-year terms specialises in legislation elections were last held between november 2011 and january 2012 which was later dissolved the next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution's ratification on 18 january 2014 originally the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected but interim president adly mansour pushed the date the egyptian presidential election 2014 took place on 2628 may 2014 official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5% with abdel fattah el-sisi winning with 23.78 million votes or 96.91% compared to 757,511 (3.09%) for hamdeen sabahi

in 2013 freedom house rated political rights in egypt at 5 (with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least) and civil liberties at 5 which gave it the freedom rating of partly free
egyptian nationalism predates its arab counterpart by many decades having roots in the 19th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of egyptian anti-colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century the ideology espoused by islamists such as the muslim brotherhood is mostly supported by the lower-middle strata of egyptian society
egypt has the oldest continuous parliamentary tradition in the arab world the first popular assembly was established in 1866 it was disbanded as a result of the british occupation of 1882 and the british allowed only a consultative body to sit in 1923 however after the country's independence was declared a new constitution provided for a parliamentary monarchy
=== law ===
the legal system is based on islamic and civil law (particularly napoleonic codes) and judicial review by a supreme court which accepts compulsory international court of justice jurisdiction only with reservations
islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation sharia courts and qadis are run and licensed by the ministry of justice the personal status law that regulates matters such as marriage divorce and child custody is governed by sharia in a family court a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's testimony

partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world this in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the arab spring poor operation of facilities such as water and wastewater treatment plants as well as limited government accountability and transparency are also issues
