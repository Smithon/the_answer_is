== etymology ==
the word brazil comes from brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ("ember") and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium) as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly tupi) along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders (mostly portuguese but also french) in return for assorted european consumer goods
the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross (terra da santa cruz) but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil (terra do brasil) on account of the brazilwood trade the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name early sailors sometimes also called it the land of parrots (terra di papaga)
in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees
== history ==
=== pre-cabraline era ===
one of the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 bc) the pottery was found near santarm and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture
around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g the tupis guaranis gs and arawaks) the tup people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambs and there were also many subdivision of the other groups
before the arrival of europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on pows while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations
=== portuguese colonization ===
the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro lvares cabral the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupiguarani family and fought among themselves though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization was effectively begun in 1534 when king dom joo iii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil
however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazil's most important exportation product and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa (not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique) had become its largest import to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar
by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy fostering a brazilian gold rush attracting thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world which in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers
portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranho during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutchportuguese war after the end of iberian union
the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of its wealthiest and largest colony both keep under control and eradicate all forms of slaves rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares as well as repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy
=== united kingdom with portugal ===
in late 1807 spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joo in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to brazil there they established some of brazil's first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges a national bank and ended the monopoly of the colony trade with portugal opening it to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana
with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joo return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state however such a ploy didn't last long since the leadership in portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon (as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820) as well as groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as showed by the 1817 pernambucan revolt in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto d joo vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcntara as regent of the kingdom of brazil
=== independent empire ===
tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the country's independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the regnal title of dom pedro i resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil
the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825
in 7 april 1831 worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedro i went to portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the empire's second monarch with the regnal title of dom pedro ii)
as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem the mal revolt the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841
during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished
the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedro ii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history
on 15 november 1889 worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons) the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup
=== early republic ===
the early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power
little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getlio vargas supported by most of the military led a successful revolt vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with his own supporters
in the 1930s three major attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred in the second half of 1932 in november 1935 and in may 1938 being the second one the communist revolt used as an excuse for the preclusion of elections put into effect by a coup d'tat in 1937 which made the vargas regime a full dictatorship noted for its brutality and censorship of the press
in foreign policy the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations after its involvement in world war i in world war ii brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with axis powers in the wake of the pan-american conference
with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being reinstated by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950
=== contemporary era ===
several brief interim governments succeeded after vargas's suicide juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of braslia inaugurated in 1960 his successor was jnio quadros who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office his vice-president joo goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime
the new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968 the oppression was not limited to only those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society inside and outside the country (through the infamous operation condor") despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes in history due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s
slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began its slow return to democracy which would be completed during the 1980s
civilians returned to power in 1985 when jos sarney assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown fernando collor who was subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso as minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998
the peaceful transition of power from fernando henrique to his main opposition leader lus incio lula da silva who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 proved that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president dilma rousseff the country's first woman president and as such one of the most powerful women in the world
in june 2013 following the viral phenomenon of worldwide manifestations (such as the arab spring the occupy wall street and the spanish indignados") numerous protests erupted in brazil for days hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in several cities to protest initially a movement against the increase in public transport fares it assumed gigantic proportions sparked by the excessive use of force by the state polices turning into a series of huge demonstrations by groups and individuals angry about a range of issues (including new stadium projects for international sports events demands on quality of public services anger about corruption and opposition to a constitutional amendment proposal pec 37 which is interpreted by some as an attempt to curb repression of corruption) thus it became a movement containing conflicting ideologies with so far no single political agenda nor recognizable leadership
== geography ==
brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of south america and includes much of the continent's interior sharing land borders with uruguay to the south argentina and paraguay to the southwest bolivia and peru to the west colombia to the northwest and venezuela guyana suriname and the french overseas department of french guiana to the north it shares a border with every south american country except ecuador and chile it also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos such as fernando de noronha rocas atoll saint peter and paul rocks and trindade and martim vaz its size relief climate and natural resources make brazil geographically diverse including its atlantic islands brazil lies between latitudes 6n and 34s and longitudes 28 and 74w
brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and third largest in the americas with a total area of 8,515,767.049 km2 (3,287,956 sq mi) including 55,455 km2 (21,411 sq mi) of water it spans four time zones from utc5 comprising the state of acre and the westernmost portion of amazonas to utc4 in the western states to utc3 in the eastern states (the national time) and utc2 in the atlantic islands brazil is the only country in the world that lies on the equator while having contiguous territory outside the tropics brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills mountains plains highlands and scrublands much of the terrain lies between 200 metres (660 ft) and 800 metres (2,600 ft) in elevation the main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country the northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad rolling terrain broken by low rounded hills
the southeastern section is more rugged with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) these ranges include the mantiqueira and espinhao mountains and the serra do mar in the north the guiana highlands form a major drainage divide separating rivers that flow south into the amazon basin from rivers that empty into the orinoco river system in venezuela to the north the highest point in brazil is the pico da neblina at 2,994 metres (9,823 ft) and the lowest is the atlantic ocean
brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers one of the world's most extensive with eight major drainage basins all of which drain into the atlantic major rivers include the amazon (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water) the paran and its major tributary the iguau (which includes the iguazu falls) the negro so francisco xingu madeira and tapajs rivers
=== climate ===
the climate of brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography but most of the country is tropical according to the kppen system brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes equatorial tropical semiarid highland tropical temperate and subtropical the different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central brazil many regions have starkly different microclimates
an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil there is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls temperatures average 25 c (77 f) with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons
over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate this region is as extensive as the amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude in the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme the semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres (31.5 in) of rain most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought brazil's 187778 grande seca (great drought) the worst in brazil's history caused approximately half a million deaths a similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915
south of bahia near the coasts and more southerly most of the state of so paulo the distribution of rainfall changes with rain falling throughout the year the south enjoys subtropical conditions with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18 c (64.4 f) winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas
=== biodiversity and environment ===
brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems such as the amazon rainforest recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world with the atlantic forest and the cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity in the south the araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions the rich wildlife of brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in brazil could approach four million mostly invertebrates
larger mammals include carnivores pumas jaguars ocelots rare bush dogs and foxes and herbivores peccaries tapirs anteaters sloths opossums and armadillos deer are plentiful in the south and many species of new world monkeys are found in the northern rain forests concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues brazil's amazon basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species including the red-bellied piranha despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger biodiversity can contribute to agriculture livestock forestry and fisheries extraction however almost all economically exploited species of plants such as soybeans and coffee or animals such as chickens are imported from other countries and the economic use of native species still crawls in the brazilian gdp the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%
the natural heritage of brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture logging mining resettlement oil and gas extraction over-fishing wildlife trade dams and infrastructure water pollution climate change fire and invasive species in many areas of the country the natural environment is threatened by development construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the amazon region including the controversial belo monte hydroelectric dam
== government and politics ==
the form of government is that of a democratic federative republic with a presidential system the president is both head of state and head of government of the union and is elected for a four-year term with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term the current president is dilma rousseff who was inaugurated on 1 january 2011 the president appoints the ministers of state who assist in government legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in brazil the national congress is the federation's bicameral legislature consisting of the chamber of deputies and the federal senate judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively brazil is a democracy according to the democracy index 2010
the brazilian federation is the indissoluble union of the states the municipalities and the federal district the union the states and the federal district and the municipalities are the spheres of government the federation is set on five fundamental principles sovereignty citizenship dignity of human beings the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise and political pluralism the classic tripartite branches of government (executive legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the constitution the executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/federal district spheres
all members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams for most of its democratic history brazil has had a multi-party system proportional representation voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70
together with several smaller parties four political parties stand out workers party (pt) brazilian social democracy party (psdb) brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb) and democrats (dem) fifteen political parties are represented in congress it is common for politicians to switch parties and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the executive
=== law ===
brazilian law is based on roman-germanic traditions and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice most of brazilian law is codified although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part playing a complementary role court decisions set out interpretive guidelines however they are seldom binding on other specific cases doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases
the legal system is based on the federal constitution which was promulgated on 5 october 1988 and is the fundamental law of brazil all other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules as of april 2007 there have been 53 amendments states have their own constitutions which must not contradict the federal constitution municipalities and the federal district have organic laws (leis orgnicas) which act in a similar way to constitutions legislative entities are the main source of statutes although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities although in rare situations the federal constitution allows the federal senate to pass on legal judgments there are also specialized military labor and electoral courts the highest court is the supreme federal court
this system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings nevertheless the supreme federal tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television and also via youtube more recently in december 2009 the supreme court adopted twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers to inform the daily actions of the court and the most important decisions made by them
=== military ===
the armed forces of brazil are the second largest in latin america by active personnel and the largest by the level of military equipment it consists of the brazilian army (including the army aviation command) the brazilian navy (including the marine corps and naval aviation) and the brazilian air force
the army has 235,978 active personnel the states military police and the military firefighters corps are described as an ancillary forces of the army by the constitution but are under the control of each state's governor the navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two minas geraes-class dreadnoughts which sparked a south american dreadnought race between argentina brazil and chile today it is a green water force and one of the ten navies that possess an aircraft carrier the air force has about 700 manned aircraft in service
brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the paraguayan war additionally brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours and neither does it have rivalries like chile and bolivia have with each other the brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the brazilian government it has built a tradition of participating in un peacekeeping missions such as in haiti and east timor
=== foreign policy ===
brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the federal constitution which establishes non-intervention self-determination international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations according to the constitution the president has ultimate authority over foreign policy while the congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties as well as legislation relating to brazilian foreign policy
brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a regional power in latin america a leader among developing countries and an emerging world power brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism peaceful dispute settlement and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries
an increasingly well-developed tool of brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes
technical cooperation of around $480 million ($30 million in 2010 provided directly by the brazilian cooperation agency (abc))
an estimated $450 million for in-kind expertise provided by brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation
in addition brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in haiti ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the world food programme ($300 million) this is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies the scale of this aid places it on par with china and india the brazilian south-south aid has been described as a global model in waiting.
=== law enforcement and crime ===
in brazil the constitution establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement federal police department federal highway police federal railroad police military police and civil police of these the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments all police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or estadual powers the national public security force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country
the country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide in 2012 the world health organization (who) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants one of the highest rates of intentional homicide of the world the number considered tolerable by the who is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants however there are differences between the crime rates in the brazilian states while in so paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in alagoas it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants
brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only china and the united states) with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (june 2014) an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992 the high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the brazilian prison system leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations
=== administrative divisions ===
brazil is a federation composed of 26 states one federal district (which contains the capital city braslia) and municipalities states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal government they have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters they also have independent courts of law for common justice despite this states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the united states for example criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral congress and are uniform throughout the country
the states and the federal district may be grouped into regions northern northeast central-west southeast and southern the brazilian regions are merely geographical not political or administrative divisions and they do not have any specific form of government although defined by law brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects
municipalities as the states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the union and state government each has a mayor and an elected legislative body but no separate court of law indeed a court of law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca (county)

according to the world tourism organization (wto) international travel to brazil accelerated in 2000 particularly during 2004 and 2005 however in 2006 a slow-down took place and international arrivals had almost no growth in 200708 in spite of this trend revenues from international tourism continued to rise from usd 4 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2007 despite 330 000 fewer arrivals this favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the us dollar against the brazilian real which began in 2004 but which makes brazil a more expensive international destination this trend changed in 2009 when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the great recession of 200809 by 2010 the industry had recovered and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.2 million international visitors and receipts from these visitors reached usd 6 billion in 2011 the historical record was reached with 5.4 million visitors and us$6.8 billion in receipts
despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues the number of brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003 resulting in a net negative foreign exchange balance as more money is spent abroad by brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting brazil tourism expenditures abroad grew from usd 5.8 billion in 2006 to usd 8.2 billion in 2007 a 42% increase representing a net deficit of usd 3.3 billion in 2007 as compared to usd 1.5 billion in 2006 a 125% increase from the previous year this trend is caused by brazilians taking advantage of the stronger real to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4% of the country's population
in 2005 tourism contributed with 3.2% of the country's revenues from exports of goods and services and represented 7% of direct and indirect employment in the brazilian economy in 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 1.9 million people domestic tourism is a fundamental market segment for the industry as 51 million people traveled throughout the country in 2005 and direct revenues from brazilian tourists reached usd 22 billion 5.6 times more receipts than international tourists in 2005

== demographics ==
the population of brazil as recorded by the 2008 pnad was approximately 190 million (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometre or 57.8/sq mi) with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban the population is heavily concentrated in the southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions while the two most extensive regions the center-west and the north which together make up 64.12% of the brazilian territory have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants
the first census in brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478 from 1880 to 1930 4 million europeans arrived brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970 because of a decline in the mortality rate even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline in the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4% rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007 it has been steadily falling since the 1960s from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of 0.29% by 2050 thus completing the demographic transition

=== race and ethnicity ===
according to the national research by household sample (pnad) of 2008 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as white 43.80% (about 83 million) as pardo (brown) 6.84% (about 13 million) as black 0.58% (about 1.1 million) as asian and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as amerindian (officially called indgena indigenous) while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race
in 2007 the national indian foundation estimated that brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes up from their estimate of 40 in 2005 brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world
since the arrival of the portuguese in 1500 considerable miscegenation between amerindians europeans and africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with european ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population accounting for between 65% to 77%)
brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines although a high income disparity is found between race groups so racism and classism can be conflated socially significant closeness to one racial group is taken in account more in the basis of appearance (phenotypes) rather than ancestry to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups socioeconomic factors are also significant because a minority of pardos are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry (usually afro-brazilians are evenly mixed and european ancestry is dominant in whites and pardos with a significant non-european contribution but the individual variation is great)
the brown population (officially called pardo in portuguese also colloquially moreno) is a broad category that includes caboclos (assimilated amerindians in general and descendants of whites and natives) mulatos (descendants of primarily whites and afro-brazilians) and cafuzos (descendants of afro-brazilians and natives) people of considerable amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the northern northeastern and center-western regions
higher percents of blacks mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the northeastern region from bahia to paraba and also in northern maranho southern minas gerais and in eastern rio de janeiro from the 19th century brazil opened its borders to immigration about five million people from over 60 countries migrated to brazil between 1808 and 1972 most of them of portuguese italian spanish german ukrainian polish jewish russian chinese japanese and arab origin
=== religion ===
religion in brazil formed from the meeting of the catholic church with the religious traditions of enslaved african peoples and indigenous peoples this confluence of faiths during the portuguese colonization of brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of brazilian catholic church characterized by traditional portuguese festivities and in some instances allan kardec's spiritism (most brazilian spiritists are also christians) religious pluralism increased during the 20th century and the protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population the most common protestant denominations are pentecostal and evangelical ones other protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the baptists seventh-day adventists lutherans and the reformed tradition
roman catholicism is the country's predominant faith brazil has the world's largest catholic population according to the 2000 demographic census (the pnad survey does not inquire about religion) 73.57% of the population followed roman catholicism 15.41% protestantism 1.33% kardecist spiritism 1.22% other christian denominations 0.31% afro-brazilian religions 0.13% buddhism 0.05% judaism 0.02% islam 0.01% amerindian religions 0.59% other religions undeclared or undetermined while 7.35% have no religion
however in the last ten years protestantism particularly pentecostalism and evangelicalism has spread in brazil while the proportion of catholics has dropped significantly after protestantism individuals professing no religion are also a significant group exceeding 7% of the population as of the 2000 census the cities of boa vista salvador and porto velho have the greatest proportion of irreligious residents in brazil teresina fortaleza and florianpolis were the most roman catholic in the country greater rio de janeiro not including the city proper is the most irreligious and least roman catholic brazilian periphery while greater porto alegre and greater fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists respectively

=== language ===
the official language of brazil is portuguese (article 13 of the constitution of the federal republic of brazil) which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers radio television and for business and administrative purposes the most famous exception to this is a strong sign language law that was passed by the national congress of brazil legally recognized in 2002 the law was regulated in 2005 the law mandates the use of the brazilian sign language more commonly known by its portuguese acronym libras in education and government services the language must be taught as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula libras teachers instructors and translators are recognized professionals schools and health services must provide access ("inclusion") to deaf people
brazilian portuguese has had its own development mostly similar to 16th-century central and southern dialects of european portuguese (despite a very substantial number of portuguese colonial settlers and more recent immigrants coming from northern regions and in minor degree portuguese macaronesia) with a few influences from the amerindian and african languages especially west african and bantu restricted to the vocabulary only as a result the language is somewhat different mostly in phonology from the language of portugal and other portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries partly because of the more recent end of portuguese colonialism in these regions have a closer connexion to contemporary european portuguese) these differences are comparable to those between american and british english
brazil is the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americas making the language an important part of brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its spanish-speaking neighbors
in 1990 the community of portuguese language countries (cplp) which included representatives from all countries with portuguese as the official language reached an agreement on the reform of the portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other this spelling reform went into effect in brazil on 1 january 2009 in portugal the reform was signed into law by the president on 21 july 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period during which both orthographies will co-exist the remaining cplp countries are free to establish their own transition timetables
minority languages are spoken throughout the nation one hundred and eighty amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants in the municipality of so gabriel da cachoeira nheengatu (a currently endangered south american creole language or an anti-creole according to some linguists with mostly indigenous brazilian languages lexicon and portuguese-based grammar that together with its southern relative lngua geral paulista once was a major lingua franca in brazil being replaced by portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changes) baniwa and tucano languages had been granted co-official status with portuguese
there are significant communities of german (mostly the brazilian hunsrckisch a high german language dialect) and italian (mostly the talian a venetian dialect) origins in the southern and southeastern regions whose ancestors native languages were carried along to brazil and which still alive there are influenced by the portuguese language talian is officially a historic patrimony of rio grande do sul and two german dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities
learning at least one second language (generally english or spanish) is mandatory for all the 12 grades of the mandatory education system (primary and secondary education there called ensino fundamental and ensino mdio respectively) brazil is the first country in south america to offer esperanto to secondary students
