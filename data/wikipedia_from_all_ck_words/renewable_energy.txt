renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation air and water heating/cooling motor fuels and rural (off-grid) energy services
based on ren21's 2014 report renewables contributed 19 percent to our global energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013 respectively this energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass) 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% is electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us$214 billion in 2013 with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels
renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond
while many renewable energy projects are large-scale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity
== overview ==
renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight wind tides plant growth and geothermal heat as the international energy agency explains
renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly in its various forms it derives directly from the sun or from heat generated deep within the earth included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar wind ocean hydropower biomass geothermal resources and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources
renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency and technological diversification of energy sources would result in significant energy security and economic benefits it would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several 100 billion dollars annually only in the united states renewable energy sources that derive their energy from the sun either directly or indirectly such as hydro and wind are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist
climate change and global warming concerns coupled with high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment
as of 2011 small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the european union by 2020 some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables outside europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 20202030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%
renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation hot water/space heating motor fuels and rural (off-grid) energy services
power generation
renewable hydroelectric energy provides 16.3% of the worlds electricity when hydroelectric is combined with other renewables such as wind geothermal solar biomass and waste together they make the renewables total 21.7% of electricity generation worldwide as of 2013 renewable power generators are spread across many countries and wind power alone already provides a significant share of electricity in some areas for example 14% in the u.s state of iowa 40% in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein and 49% in denmark some countries get most of their power from renewables including iceland (100%) norway (98%) brazil (86%) austria (62%) new zealand (65%) and sweden (54%)
heating
solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in china which now has 70% of the global total (180 gwth) most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 5060 million households in china worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households the use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well in sweden national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly
transport fuels
renewable biofuels have contributed to a significant decline in oil consumption in the united states since 2006 u.s oil use fell 8.5% from 2005 to 2014 the 93 billion liters of biofuels produced worldwide in 2009 displaced the equivalent of an estimated 68 billion liters of gasoline equal to about 5% of world gasoline production
== history ==
prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from 790,000 years ago use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water this practice can be traced back some 7000 years to ships on the nile moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills and firewood a traditional biomass a graph of energy use in the united states up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010
by 1873 concerns of running out of coal prompted experiments with using solar energy development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i the importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 scientific american article in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race
the theory of peak oil was published in 1956 in the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity generating wind turbines appeared solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980
the iea 2014 world energy outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4,550 gigawatts in 2040 fossil fuels received about $550 billion in subsidies in 2013 compared to $120 billion for all renewable energies
== mainstream technologies ==
=== wind power ===
airflows can be used to run wind turbines modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kw to 5 mw of rated power although turbines with rated output of 1.53 mw have become the most common for commercial use the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high altitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms typical capacity factors are 20-40% with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favorable sites
globally the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or 40 times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore as offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines in 2013 wind generated almost 3% of the worlds total electricity
=== hydropower ===
energy in water can be harnessed and used since water is about 800 times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy there are many forms of water energy
hydroelectric energy is a term usually reserved for large-scale hydroelectric dams the largest of which is the three gorges dam in china and a smaller example is the akosombo dam in ghana
micro hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100 kw of power they are often used in water rich areas as a remote-area power supply (raps)
run-of-the-river hydroelectricity systems derive kinetic energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir
hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 for counties having the largest percentage of electricity from renewables the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use there are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 gw the three gorges dam in china itaipu dam across the brazil/paraguay border and guri dam in venezuela
wave power which captures the energy of ocean surface waves and tidal power converting the energy of tides are two forms of hydropower with future potential however they are not yet widely employed commercially a demonstration project operated by the ocean renewable power company on the coast of maine and connected to the grid harnesses tidal power from the bay of fundy location of world's highest tidal flow ocean thermal energy conversion which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters has currently no economic feasibility in 2013 hydropower generated almost 16% of the worlds total electricity
=== solar energy ===
solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating photovoltaics concentrated solar power solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy using solar collectors for heating and solar power converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (pv) or indirectly using concentrated solar power (csp)
a photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (dc) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect solar pv has turned into a multi-billion fast-growing industry continues to improve its cost-effectiveness and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with csp concentrated solar power (csp) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s csp-stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies
in 2011 the international energy agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared in 2013 solar generated less than 1% of the worlds total grid electricity
=== geothermal energy ===
geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the earth thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions) the geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots geo meaning earth and thermos meaning heat
the heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the earth all the way down to earth's core 4,000 miles (6,400 km) down at the core temperatures may reach over 9,000 f (5,000 c) heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt which is commonly known as magma magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock this magma then heats rock and water in the crust sometimes up to 700 f (371 c)
from hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times but it is now better known for electricity generation
=== bio energy ===
biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass as an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods wood remains the largest biomass energy source today examples include forest residues such as dead trees branches and tree stumps  yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste in the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil)
plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yield 7.58 tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yield 3.55 tonnes per hectare in the uk the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel
biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas also called landfill gas or biogas crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats also biomass to liquids (btls) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research there is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture such as corn and soy once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol butanol and methane as well as biodiesel and hydrogen the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region forest by-products such as wood residues are common in the united states agricultural waste is common in mauritius (sugar cane residue) and southeast asia (rice husks) animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the united kingdom
biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass the term covers solid liquid and gaseous fuels liquid biofuels include bioalcohols such as bioethanol and oils such as biodiesel gaseous biofuels include biogas landfill gas and synthetic gas bioethanol is an alcoho] made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops these include maize sugarcane and more recently sweet sorghum the latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions and is being investigated by international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa
with advanced technology being developed cellulosic biomass such as trees and grasses are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the united states and in brazil the energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to the energy yields from bio-ethanol however according to the european environment agency biofuels do not address global warming concerns biodiesel is made from vegetable oils animal fats or recycled greases it can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010
biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (sox) nitrous oxides (nox) and particulate matter (pm) are produced from the combustion of biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution biomass combustion is a major contributor the life cycle of the plants is sustainable the lives of people less so
=== heat pump ===
a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one a heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink
while air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps the term heat pump is more general and applies to many hvac (heating ventilating and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling when a heat pump is used for heating it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction - releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment in this use heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground in heating mode heat pumps are three to four times more efficient in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters
in the context of renewable energy heat pumps are able to use electricity from renewable sources to provide heating and cooling of structures in a cost and energy effective way displacing non renewable sources it has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market with a market share of 30% heat pumps could reduce global co2 emissions by 8% annually using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the primary energy demand and 90% of co2 emissions in europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion
=== grid energy storage ===
grid energy storage (also called large-scale energy storage) is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on a large scale within an electrical power grid electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power tidal power solar power) exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption
== commercialization ==
=== growth of renewables ===
from the end of 2004 worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 1060% annually for many technologies for wind power and many other renewable technologies growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years more wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology however grid-connected pv increased the fastest of all renewables technologies with a 60% annual average growth rate in 2010 renewable power constituted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities
projections vary but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100% of the world's energy with wind hydroelectric and solar power by the year 2030
according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment cedric philibert senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the iea said photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060 and half of all energy needs with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity philibert said
wind power is growing at the rate of 30% annually with a worldwide installed capacity of 282,482 megawatts (mw) at the end of 2012 and is widely used in europe asia and the united states at the end of 2012 the photovoltaic (pv) capacity worldwide was 100,000 mw and pv power stations are popular in germany and italy solar thermal energy stations operate in the usa and spain and the largest of these is the 354 mw solar energy generating systems power plant in the mojave desert the world's largest geothermal power installation is the geysers in california with a rated capacity of 750 mw brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel ethanol fuel is also widely available in the usa
=== economic trends ===
renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition a 2011 iea report said a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support, and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue.
hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity (lcoe) is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic (pv) concentrated solar power (csp) and some biomass technologies renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources as the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity where oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g on islands off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today a series of studies by the us national renewable energy laboratory modeled the grid in the western us under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power. in the models inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of between $0.47 and $1.28 to each megawatt hour generated however the savings in the cost of the fuels saved adds up to $7 billion meaning the added costs are at most two percent of the savings.
=== hydroelectricity ===
only 25% of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 twh/year has been developed with africa asia and latin america having the greatest potential the three gorges dam in hubei china has the world's largest instantaneous generating capacity (22,500 mw) with the itaipu dam in brazil/paraguay in second place (14,000 mw) the three gorges dam is operated jointly with the much smaller gezhouba dam (3,115 mw) as of 2012 the total generating capacity of this two-dam complex is 25,615 mw in 2008 this complex generated 98 twh of electricity (81 twh from the three gorges dam and 17 twh from the gezhouba dam) which is 3% more power in one year than the 95 twh generated by itaipu in 2008
=== wind power development ===
wind power is widely used in europe china and the united states from 2004 to 2014 worldwide installed capacity of wind power has been growing from 47 gw to 369 gwa more than sevenfold increase within 10 years with 2014 breaking a new record in global installations (51 gw) as of the end of 2014 china the united states and germany combined accounted for half of total global capacity several other countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration such as 21% of stationary electricity production in denmark 18% in portugal 16% in spain and 14% in ireland in 2010 and have since continued to expand their installed capacity more than 80 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis
offshore wind power
as of 2014 offshore wind power amounted to 8,771 megawatt of global installed capacity although offshore capacity doubled within three years (from 4,117 mw in 2011) it accounted for only 2.3% of the total wind power capacity the united kingdom is the undisputed leader of offshore power with half of the world's installed capacity ahead of denmark germany belgium and china
list of offshore and onshore wind farms
as of 2012 the alta wind energy center (california 1,020 mw) is the world's largest wind farm the london array (630 mw) is the largest offshore wind farm in the world the united kingdom is the world's leading generator of offshore wind power followed by denmark there are several large offshore wind farms under construction and these include anholt (400 mw) bard (400 mw) clyde (548 mw) fntnele-cogealac (600 mw) greater gabbard (500 mw) lincs (270 mw) london array (1000 mw) lower snake river (343 mw) macarthur (420 mw) shepherds flat (845 mw) and the sheringham shoal (317 mw)
=== solar thermal ===
the united states conducted much early research in photovoltaics and concentrated solar power the u.s is among the top countries in the world in electricity generated by the sun and several of the world's largest utility-scale installations are located in the desert southwest
the oldest solar thermal power plant in the world is the 354 megawatt (mw) segs thermal power plant in california the ivanpah solar electric generating system is a solar thermal power project in the california mojave desert 40 miles (64 km) southwest of las vegas with a gross capacity of 377 mw the 280 mw solana generating station is a solar power plant near gila bend arizona about 70 miles (110 km) southwest of phoenix completed in 2013 when commissioned it was the largest parabolic trough plant in the world and the first u.s solar plant with molten salt thermal energy storage
the solar thermal power industry is growing rapidly with 1.3 gw under construction in 2012 and more planned spain is the epicenter of solar thermal power development with 873 mw under construction and a further 271 mw under development in the united states 5,600 mw of solar thermal power projects have been announced several power plants have been constructed in the mojave desert southwestern united states the ivanpah solar power facility being the most recent in developing countries three world bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in egypt mexico and morocco have been approved
=== photovoltaic development ===
photovoltaics (pv) uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity it's a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years pv systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment in recent years pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time and has reached grid parity in at least 30 different markets by 2014 financial institutions are predicting a second solar gold rush in the near future
at the end of 2014 worldwide pv capacity reached at least 177,000 megawatts photovoltaics grew fastest in china followed by japan and the united states while germany remains the world's largest overall producer of photovoltaic power contributing about 7.0 percent to the overall electricity generation italy meets 7.9 percent of its electricity demands with photovoltaic powerthe highest share worldwide for 2015 global cumulative capacity is forecasted to increase by more than 50 gigawatts (gw) by 2018 worldwide capacity is projected to reach as much as 430 gigawatts this corresponds to a tripling within five years solar power is forecasted to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050 with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16% and 11% respectively this requires an increase of installed pv capacity to 4,600 gw of which more than half is expected to be deployed in china and india
=== photovoltaic power stations ===
many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in europe as of may 2012 the largest photovoltaic (pv) power plants in the world are the agua caliente solar project (usa 247 mw) charanka solar park (india 214 mw) golmud solar park (china 200 mw) perovo solar park (ukraine 100 mw) sarnia photovoltaic power plant (canada 97 mw) brandenburg-briest solarpark (germany 91 mw) solarpark finow tower (germany 84.7 mw) montalto di castro photovoltaic power station (italy 84.2 mw) and the eggebek solar park (germany 83.6 mw)
there are also many large plants under construction the desert sunlight solar farm is a 550 mw solar power plant under construction in riverside county california that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by first solar the topaz solar farm is a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant being built in san luis obispo county california the blythe solar power project is a 500 mw photovoltaic station under construction in riverside county california the california valley solar ranch (cvsr) is a 250 mw solar photovoltaic power plant which is being built by sunpower in the carrizo plain northeast of california valley the 230 mw antelope valley solar ranch is a first solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the antelope valley area of the western mojave desert and due to be completed in 2013
many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations
however when it comes to renewable energy systems and pv it is not just large systems that matter building-integrated photovoltaics or onsite pv systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed
=== carbon-neutral and negative fuels ===
carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic fuels (including methane gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel or ammonia) produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue-gas emissions recovered from automotive exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater such fuels are considered carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases to the extent that synthetic fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation
such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage alleviating the problems of wind and solar intermittency and they enable distribution of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day so the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts
the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant in grindavk iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011 it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year
=== biofuel development ===
biofuels provided 3% of the world's transport fuel in 2010 mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces according to the international energy agency biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050
since the 1970s brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of ethanol (after the united states) and the world's largest exporter brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock and the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to produce heat and power there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline by the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump
nearly all the gasoline sold in the united states today is mixed with 10% ethanol a mix known as e10 and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimler ag and gm are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (e85) by mid-2006 there were approximately 6 million e85-compatible vehicles on u.s roads the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability the energy policy act of 2005 which calls for 7.5 billion us gallons (28,000,000 m3) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 will also help to expand the market
=== geothermal development ===
geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels as a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels
the international geothermal association (iga) has reported that 10,715 mw of geothermal power in 24 countries is online which is expected to generate 67,246 gwh of electricity in 2010 this represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005 iga projects this will grow to 18,500 mw by 2015 due to the large number of projects presently under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource
in 2010 the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power plants the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with 1,904 mw of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 18% of the country's electricity generation

renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries in rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative
technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity even though they are typically very poor these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar pv systems kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita more than 30,000 very small solar panels each producing 12 to 30 watts are sold in kenya annually some small island developing states (sids) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability
micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary starchy and cellulostic feedstocks project gaia inc and cleanstar mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in ethiopia kenya nigeria and mozambique
renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools
=== industry and policy trends ===
u.s president barack obama's american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs leading renewable energy companies include first solar gamesa ge energy hanwha q cells sharp solar siemens sunopta suntech power and vestas
the military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage the us military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources
the international renewable energy agency (irena) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer irena was formed on 26 january 2009 by 75 countries signing the charter of irena as of march 2010 irena has 143 member states who all are considered as founding members of which 14 have also ratified the statute
as of 2011 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy national targets now exist in at least 98 countries there is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels
united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity in october 2011 he announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy the group is to be co-chaired by kandeh yumkella the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation and charles holliday chairman of bank of america
=== 100% renewable energy ===
the incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of stabilization wedges that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources, in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges.
mark z jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program says producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic jacobson says that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to today's energy costs
similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand. 
the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints
== emerging technologies ==
other renewable energy technologies are still under development and include cellulosic ethanol hot-dry-rock geothermal power and marine energy these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research development and demonstration (rd&d) funding
there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion while nrel has a budget of $375 million
enhanced geothermal system
enhanced geothermal systems (egs) are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources the vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock egs technologies enhance and/or create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock (hdr) through hydraulic stimulation egs and hdr technologies like hydrothermal geothermal are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant distinct from hydrothermal hdr and egs may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (35 km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss there are hdr and egs systems currently being developed and tested in france australia japan germany the u.s and switzerland the largest egs project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the cooper basin australia the cooper basin has the potential to generate 5,00010,000 mw
cellulosic ethanol
several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethano are built by companies such as iogen poet and abengoa while other companies such as the verenium corporation novozymes and dyadic international are producing enzymes which could enable future commercialization the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors
artificial photosynthesis
artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired non-toxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds i.e. carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells) however prominent research faces hurdles sun catalytix a mit spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight
algae fuels
producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands
experimental solar power
concentrated photovoltaics (cpv) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation thermoelectric or thermovoltaic devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current
marine energy
marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power power from surface waves and tidal power obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world
== debate ==
renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent but is not true for concentrated solar geothermal and biofuels that have continuity in any case the international energy agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and through local generation contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks
there have been not in my back yard (nimby) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction in the usa the massachusetts cape wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns however residents in other areas have been more positive according to a town councilor the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the ardrossan wind farm in scotland has enhanced the area
a recent uk government document states that projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities this means giving communities both a say and a stake in countries such as germany and denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities particularly through cooperative structures and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment
the market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs coupled with high oil prices peak oil oil wars oil spills promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity nuclear disasters and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors
