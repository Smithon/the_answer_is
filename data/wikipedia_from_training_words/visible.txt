the neutron is a subatomic particle symbol n or n0 with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton protons and neutrons each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit constitute the nucleus of an atom and they are collectively referred to as nucleons their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics
the nucleus consists of z protons where z is called the atomic number and n neutrons where n is the neutron number the atomic number defines the chemical properties of the atom and the neutron number determines the isotope or nuclide the terms isotope and nuclide are often used synonymously but they refer to chemical and nuclear properties respectively the atomic mass number symbol a equals z+n for example carbon has atomic number 6 and its abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6 neutrons whereas its rare carbon-13 isotope has 7 neutrons some elements occur in nature with only one stable isotope such as fluorine (see stable nuclide) other elements occur as many stable isotopes such as tin with ten stable isotopes even though it is not a chemical element the neutron is included in the table of nuclides
within the nucleus protons and neutrons are bound together through the nuclear force and neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear fission and fusion they are a primary contributor to the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements within stars through fission fusion and neutron capture processes
the neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power in the decade after the neutron was discovered in 1932 neutrons were used to effect many different types of nuclear transmutations with the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938 it was quickly realized that if a fission event produced neutrons each of these neutrons might cause further fission events etc. in a cascade known as a nuclear chain reaction these events and findings led to the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor (chicago pile-1 1942) and the first nuclear weapon (trinity 1945)
free neutrons or individual neutrons free of the nucleus are effectively a form of ionizing radiation and as such are a biological hazard depending upon dose a small natural neutron background flux of free neutrons exists on earth caused by cosmic ray muons and by the natural radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable elements in the earth's crust dedicated neutron sources like neutron generators research reactors and spallation sources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in neutron scattering experiments
== descriptionedit ==
neutrons and protons are both nucleons which are attracted and bound together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei the nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol h") is a lone proton the nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons respectively all other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons the most common nuclide of the common chemical element lead 208pb has 82 protons and 126 neutrons for example
the free neutron has a mass of about 69731675000000000001.6751027 kg (equivalent to 7002939600000000000939.6 mev/c2 or 70001008700000000001.0087 u) the neutron has a mean square radius of about 69848000000000000000.81015 m or 0.8 fm and it is a spin- fermion the neutron has a magnetic moment with a negative value because its orientation is opposite to the neutron's spin the neutron's magnetic moment causes its motion to be influenced by magnetic fields although the neutron has no net electric charge it does have a slight distribution of charge within it with its positive electric charge the proton is directly influenced by electric fields whereas the response of the neutron to this force is much weaker
a free neutron is unstable decaying to a proton electron and antineutrino with a mean lifetime of just under 15 minutes (7002881500000000000881.51.5 s) this radioactive decay known as beta decay is possible since the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than the proton the free proton is stable neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable however depending on the nuclide beta decay in which neutrons decay to protons or vice versa is governed by the weak force and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos or their antiparticles
protons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus the concept of isospin in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances the binding energy of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms nuclear reactions (such as nuclear fission) therefore have an energy density that is more than ten million times that of chemical reactions because of the massenergy equivalence nuclear binding energies add or subtract from the mass of nuclei ultimately the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible in nuclear fission the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g. uranium-235) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons the positively charged light nuclides then repel releasing electromagnetic potential energy
the neutron is classified as a hadron since it is composed of quarks and as a baryon since it is composed of three quarks the finite size of the neutron and its magnetic moment indicate the neutron is a composite rather than elementary particle the neutron consists of two down quarks with charge e and one up quark with charge + e although this simple model belies the complexities of the standard model for nuclei the masses of the three quarks sum to only about 700112000000000000012 mev/c2 whereas the neutron's mass is about 7002940000000000000940 mev/c2 for example like the proton the quarks of the neutron are held together by the strong force mediated by gluons the nuclear force results from secondary effects of the more fundamental strong force
== discoveryedit ==
the story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century leading ultimately to the atomic bomb in 1945 in the 1911 rutherford model the atom consisted of a small positively charged massive nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons in 1920 rutherford suggested that the nucleus consisted of positive protons and neutrally-charged particles suggested to be a proton and an electron bound in some way electrons were assumed to reside within the nucleus because it was known that beta radiation consisted of electrons emitted from the nucleus rutherford called these uncharged particles neutrons by the latin root for neutralis (neuter) and the greek suffix -on (a suffix used in the names of subatomic particles i.e electron and proton) references to the word neutron in connection with the atom can be found in the literature as early as 1899 however
throughout the 1920s physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was composed of protons and nuclear electrons but there were obvious problems it was difficult to reconcile the protonelectron model for nuclei with the heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics the klein paradox discovered by oskar klein in 1928 presented further quantum mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within a nucleus observed properties of atoms and molecules were inconsistent with the nuclear spin expected from protonelectron hypothesis since both protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of  there is no way to arrange an odd number of spins to give a spin integer multiple of  nuclei with integer spin are common e.g. 14n
in 1931 walther bothe and herbert becker found that if alpha particle radiation from polonium fell on beryllium boron or lithium an unusually penetrating radiation was produced the radiation was not influenced by an electric field so bothe and becker assumed it was gamma radiation the following year irne joliot-curie and frdric joliot in paris showed that if this gamma radiation fell on paraffin or any other hydrogen-containing compound it ejected protons of very high energy neither rutherford nor james chadwick at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge were convinced by the gamma ray interpretation chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments that showed that the new radiation consisted of uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton these particles were neutrons chadwick won the nobel prize in physics for this discovery in 1935
models for atomic nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by werner heisenberg and others the protonneutron model explained the puzzle of nuclear spins the origins of beta radiation were explained by enrico fermi in 1934 by the process of beta decay in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a (as yet undiscovered) neutrino in 1935 chadwick and his doctoral student maurice goldhaber reported the first accurate measurement of the mass of the neutron
by 1934 fermi had bombarded heavier elements with neutrons to induce radioactivity in elements of high atomic number in 1938 fermi received the nobel prize in physics for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons in 1938 otto hahn lise meitner and fritz strassmann discovered nuclear fission or the fractionation of uranium nuclei into light elements induced by neutron bombardment in 1945 hahn received the 1944 nobel prize in chemistry for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei. the discovery of nuclear fission would lead to the development of nuclear power and the atomic bomb by the end of world war ii
== beta decay and the stability of the nucleusedit ==
under the standard model of particle physics the only possible decay mode for the neutron that conserves baryon number is for one of the neutron's quarks to change flavour via the weak interaction the decay of one of the neutron's down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a w boson by this process the standard model description of beta decay the neutron decays into a proton (which contains one down and two up quarks) an electron and an electron antineutrino
since interacting protons have a mutual electromagnetic repulsion that is stronger than their attractive nuclear interaction neutrons are a necessary constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one proton (see diproton and neutronproton ratio) neutrons bind with protons and one another in the nucleus via the nuclear force effectively moderating the repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the nucleus
=== free neutron decayedit ===
outside the nucleus free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 7002881500000000000881.51.5 s (about 14 minutes 42 seconds) therefore the half-life for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ln(2) = 0.693) is 7002611000000000000611.01.0 s (about 10 minutes 11 seconds) beta decay of the neutron described above can be denoted by the radioactive decay
n0 p+ + e +
e
where p+ e and
e denote the proton electron and electron antineutrino respectively for the free neutron the decay energy for this process (based on the masses of the neutron proton and electron) is 0.782343 mev the maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 013 mev the latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the neutrino (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy) as well as neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods
a small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same products but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray
n0 p+ + e +
e +
this gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of internal bremsstrahlung that arises as the emitted beta particle interacts with the charge of the proton in an electromagnetic way internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below)
a very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called two-body (neutron) decays in which a proton electron and antineutrino are produced as usual but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 ev necessary energy to escape the proton and therefore simply remains bound to it as a neutral hydrogen atom (one of the two bodies") in this type of free neutron decay in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino (the other body")
the transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton
=== bound neutron decayedit ===
while a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min most neutrons within nuclei are stable according to the nuclear shell model the protons and neutrons of a nuclide are a quantum mechanical system organized into discrete energy levels with unique quantum numbers for a neutron to decay the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state in stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled meaning they are each occupied by two protons with spin up and spin down the pauli exclusion principle therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei the situation is similar to electrons of an atom where electrons have distinct atomic orbitals and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states with the emission of a photon by the exclusion principle
neutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by beta decay as described above in this case an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay one example of this decay is carbon-14 (6 protons 8 neutrons) that decays to nitrogen-14 (7 protons 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about 5,730 years
inside a nucleus a proton can transform into a neutron via inverse beta decay if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron this transformation occurs by emission of an antielectron (also called positron) and an electron neutrino
p+ n0 + e+ +
e
the transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through electron capture
p+ + e n0 +
e
positron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus and quickly annihilate when they encounter electrons
=== competition of beta decay typesedit ===
three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope copper-64 (29 protons 35 neutrons) which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours this isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron so either the proton or the neutron can decay this particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally likely to decay through proton decay by positron emission (18%) or electron capture (43%) as through neutron decay by electron emission (39%)
== intrinsic propertiesedit ==
=== electric chargeedit ===
the total electric charge of the neutron is 50000000000000000000 e this zero value has been tested experimentally and the present experimental limit for the charge of the neutron is 30217999999999999992(8)1022 e or 30407000000000000003(13)1041 c this value is consistent with zero given the experimental uncertainties (indicated in parentheses) by comparison the charge of the proton is of course 7000100000000000000+1 e
=== electric dipole momentedit ===
the standard model of particle physics predicts a tiny separation of positive and negative charge within the neutron leading to a permanent electric dipole moment the predicted value is however well below the current sensitivity of experiments from several unsolved puzzles in particle physics it is clear that the standard model is not the final and full description of all particles and their interactions new theories going beyond the standard model generally lead to much larger predictions for the electric dipole moment of the neutron currently there are at least four experiments trying to measure for the first time a finite neutron electric dipole moment including
cryogenic neutron edm experiment being set up at the institut lauelangevin
nedm experiment under construction at the new ucn source at the paul scherrer institute
nedm experiment being envisaged at the spallation neutron source
nedm experiment being built at the institut lauelangevin
=== magnetic momentedit ===
even though the neutron is a neutral particle the magnetic moment of a neutron is not zero since the neutron is a neutral particle it is not affected by electric fields but with its magnetic moment it is affected by magnetic fields the magnetic moment of the neutron is an indication of its quark substructure and internal charge distribution the value for the neutron's magnetic moment was first directly measured by luis alvarez and felix bloch at berkeley california in 1940 using an extension of the magnetic resonance methods developed by rabi alvarez and bloch determined the magnetic moment of the neutron to be n = 29998070000000000001.93(2) n where n is the nuclear magneton
=== structure and geometry of charge distributionedit ===
an article published in 2007 featuring a model-independent analysis concluded that the neutron has a negatively charged exterior a positively charged middle and a negative core in a simplified classical view the negative skin of the neutron assists it to be attracted to the protons with which it interacts in the nucleus (however the main attraction between neutrons and protons is via the nuclear force which does not involve charge.)
the simplified classical view of the neutron's charge distribution also explains the fact that the neutron magnetic dipole points in the opposite direction from its spin angular momentum vector (as compared to the proton) this gives the neutron in effect a magnetic moment which resembles a negatively charged particle this can be reconciled classically with a neutral neutron composed of a charge distribution in which the negative sub-parts of the neutron have a larger average radius of distribution and therefore contribute more to the particle's magnetic dipole moment than do the positive parts that are on average nearer the core
=== massedit ===
the mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by mass spectrometry due to lack of electric charge however since the mass of protons and deuterons can be measured by mass spectrometry the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the binding energy of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy) the latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy () of the single 69871253222448131390.7822 mev gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons) plus the small recoil kinetic energy () of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy)
the energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by x-ray diffraction techniques as was first done by bell and elliot in 1948 the best modern (1986) values for neutron mass by this technique are provided by greene et al these give a neutron mass of
mneutron = 70001008644904000001.008644904(14) u
the value for the neutron mass in mev is less accurately known due to less accuracy in the known conversion of u to mev
mneutron = 7002939565630000000939.56563(28) mev/c2
another method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta decay of the neutron when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron are measured
=== anti-neutronedit ===
the antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron it was discovered by bruce cork in the year 1956 a year after the antiproton was discovered cpt-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles so studying antineutrons yields provide stringent tests on cpt-symmetry the fractional difference in the masses of the neutron and antineutron is 6995900000000000000(96)105 since the difference is only about two standard deviations away from zero this does not give any convincing evidence of cpt-violation
== neutron compoundsedit ==
=== dineutrons and tetraneutronsedit ===
the existence of stable clusters of 4 neutrons or tetraneutrons has been hypothesised by a team led by francisco-miguel marqus at the cnrs laboratory for nuclear physics based on observations of the disintegration of beryllium-14 nuclei this is particularly interesting because current theory suggests that these clusters should not be stable
the dineutron is another hypothetical particle in 2012 artemis spyrou from michigan state university and coworkers reported that they observed for the first time the dineutron emission in the decay of 16be the dineutron character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two neutrons the authors measured the two-neutron separation energy to be 1.35(10) mev in good agreement with shell model calculations using standard interactions for this mass region
=== neutronium and neutron starsedit ===
at extremely high pressures and temperatures nucleons and electrons are believed to collapse into bulk neutronic matter called neutronium this is presumed to happen in neutron stars
the extreme pressure inside a neutron star may deform the neutrons into a cubic symmetry allowing tighter packing of neutrons
== detectionedit ==
the common means of detecting a charged particle by looking for a track of ionization (such as in a cloud chamber) does not work for neutrons directly neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable but the experiments are not as simple to carry out other means for detecting neutrons consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei are more commonly used the commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon mainly neutron capture or elastic scattering a good discussion on neutron detection is found in chapter 14 of the book radiation detection and measurement by glenn f knoll (john wiley & sons 1979)
=== neutron detection by neutron captureedit ===
a common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from neutron capture reactions into electrical signals certain nuclides have a high neutron capture cross section which is the probability of absorbing a neutron upon neutron capture the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation for example an alpha particle which is then detected the nuclides 3he 6li 10b 233u 235u 237np and 239pu are useful for this purpose
=== neutron detection by elastic scatteringedit ===
neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei causing the struck nucleus to recoil kinematically a neutron can transfer more energy to light nuclei such as hydrogen or helium than to heavier nuclei detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal a major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector
fast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator and therefore being capable of measuring the neutron's energy time of arrival and in certain cases direction of incidence
== sources and productionedit ==
free neutrons are unstable although they have the longest half-life of any unstable sub-atomic particle by several orders of magnitude their half-life is still only about 10 minutes however so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them freshly
natural neutron background a small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on earth in the atmosphere and deep into the ocean the neutron background is caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere these high energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil there in striking atomic nuclei among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus within the earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals the neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of dark matter recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of mev
even stronger neutron background radiation is produced at the surface of mars where the atmosphere is thick enough to generate neutrons from cosmic ray muon production and neutron-spallation but not thick enough to provide significant protection from the neutrons produced these neutrons not only produce a martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct downward-going neutron radiation but may also produce a significant hazard from reflection of neutrons from the martian surface which will produce reflected neutron radiation penetrating upward into a martian craft or habitat from the floor
sources of neutrons for research these include certain types of radioactive decay (spontaneous fission and neutron emission) and from certain nuclear reactions convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides often beryllium or deuterium and induced nuclear fission such as occurs in nuclear reactors in addition high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintigration of target nuclei small (tabletop) particle accelerators optimized to produce free neutrons in this way are called neutron generators
in practice the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production one noted neutron-producing radioisotope californium-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by spontaneous fission 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission and is used alone as a neutron source from this process nuclear reaction sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an alpha decay source plus a beryllium target or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes beta decay followed by gamma decay which produces photoneutrons on interaction of the high energy gamma ray with ordinary stable beryllium or else with the deuterium in heavy water a popular source of the latter type is radioactive antimony-124 plus beryllium a system with a half-life of 60.9 days which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor then transported to where the neutron source is needed
nuclear fission reactors naturally produce free neutrons their role is to sustain the energy-producing chain reaction the intense neutron radiation can also be used to produce various radioisotopes through the process of neutron activation which is a type of neutron capture
experimental nuclear fusion reactors produce free neutrons as a waste product however it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy and converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge fusion reactors that generate neutrons are likely to create radioactive waste but the waste is composed of neutron-activated lighter isotopes which have relatively short (50100 years) decay periods as compared to typical half-lives of 10,000 years for fission waste which is long due primarily to the long half-life of alpha-emitting transuranic actinides
=== neutron beams and modification of beams after productionedit ===
free neutron beams are obtained from neutron sources by neutron transport for access to intense neutron sources researchers must go to a specialist neutron facility that operates a research reactor or a spallation source
the neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or accelerate them charged particles can be accelerated decelerated or deflected by electric or magnetic fields these methods have little effect on neutrons however some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the neutron's magnetic moment neutrons can be controlled by methods that include moderation reflection and velocity selection thermal neutrons can be polarized by transmission through magnetic materials in a method analogous to the faraday effect for photons cold neutrons of wavelengths of 67 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high degree of polarization by use of magnetic mirrors and magnetized interference filters
== applicationsedit ==
the neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions for example neutron capture often results in neutron activation inducing radioactivity in particular knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons the fissioning of elements like uranium-235 and plutonium-239 is caused by their absorption of neutrons
cold thermal and hot neutron radiation is commonly employed in neutron scattering facilities where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses x-rays for the analysis of condensed matter neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering cross sections sensitivity to magnetism energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy and deep penetration into matter
the development of neutron lenses based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray tomography
a major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt gamma rays from elements in materials this forms the basis of neutron activation analysis (naa) and prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (pgnaa) naa is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a nuclear reactor whilst pgnaa is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around bore holes and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts
another use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules when a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus it loses a large fraction of its energy by measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei a neutron probe may determine the water content in soil
== medical therapiesedit ==
because neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing it can be exploited for medical treatments neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive however neutron tomography is therefore not a viable medical application
fast neutron therapy utilizes high energy neutrons typically greater than 20 mev to treat cancer radiation therapy of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation if radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas normal tissue will have time to repair itself while tumor cells often cannot neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than gamma radiation
beams of low energy neutrons are used in boron capture therapy to treat cancer in boron capture therapy the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted the tumor is then bombarded with very low energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the boron-10 isotope in the boron which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce lithium-7 and an alpha particle that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell but insufficient range to damage nearby cells for such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer a neutron source having an intensity of the order of billion (109) neutrons per second per cm2 is preferred such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor
== protectionedit ==
exposure to free neutrons can be hazardous since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to molecules and atoms and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of radiation (such as protons) the normal precautions of radiation protection apply avoid exposure stay as far from the source as possible and keep exposure time to a minimum some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure however for other types of radiation e.g. alpha particles beta particles or gamma rays material of a high atomic number and with high density make for good shielding frequently lead is used however this approach will not work with neutrons since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number as it does with alpha beta and gamma radiation instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above) for example hydrogen-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons this often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials after slowing neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation such as lithium-6
hydrogen-rich ordinary water affects neutron absorption in nuclear fission reactors usually neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required the deuterium in heavy water has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen) deuterium is therefore used in candu-type reactors in order to slow (moderate) neutron velocity to increase the probability of nuclear fission compared to neutron capture
== neutron temperatureedit ==
=== thermal neutronsedit ===
a thermal neutron is a free neutron that is boltzmann distributed with kt = 69794053506512110000.0253 ev (69793999999999999994.01021 j) at room temperature this gives characteristic (not average or median) speed of 2.2 km/s the name thermal comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating (see kinetic theory for energies and speeds of molecules) after a number of collisions (often in the range of 1020) with nuclei neutrons arrive at this energy level provided that they are not absorbed
in many substances thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e. with higher probability) by any atomic nuclei that they collide with creating a heavier and often unstable isotope of the chemical element as a result
most fission reactors use a neutron moderator to slow down or thermalize the neutrons that are emitted by nuclear fission so that they are more easily captured causing further fission others called fast breeder reactors use fission energy neutrons directly
=== cold neutronsedit ===
cold neutrons are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid deuterium such a cold source is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source cold neutrons are particularly valuable for neutron scattering experiments
=== ultracold neutronsedit ===
ultracold neutrons are produced by inelastically scattering cold neutrons in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins such as solid deuterium or superfluid helium an alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons
=== fission energy neutronsedit ===
a fast neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to 69871602176487000001 mev (69871600000000000001.61013 j) hence a speed of ~700714000000000000014000 km/s (~ 5% of the speed of light) they are named fission energy or fast neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as nuclear fission neutrons produced in fission as noted above have a maxwellboltzmann distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 mev a mean energy of 2 mev (for u-235 fission neutrons) and a mode of only 0.75 mev which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in fertile materials such as u-238 and th-232)
fast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation this is done with a neutron moderator in reactors typically heavy water light water or graphite are used to moderate neutrons
=== fusion neutronsedit ===
dt (deuteriumtritium) fusion is the fusion reaction that produces the most energetic neutrons with 14.1 mev of kinetic energy and traveling at 17% of the speed of light dt fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1 mev that will be produced
14.1 mev neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons and are very effective at fissioning even non-fissile heavy nuclei and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons this makes dt fusion neutron sources such as proposed tokamak power reactors useful for transmutation of transuranic waste 14.1 mev neutrons can also produce neutrons by knocking them loose from nuclei
on the other hand these very high energy neutrons are less likely to simply be captured without causing fission or spallation for these reasons nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes dt fusion 14.1 mev neutrons to cause more fission fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials such as depleted uranium (uranium-238) and these materials have been used in the jackets of thermonuclear weapons fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs such as reactor grade plutonium this physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain nuclear proliferation discussions and treaties
other fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons dd fusion produces a 2.45 mev neutron and helium-3 half of the time and produces tritium and a proton but no neutron the other half of the time d3he fusion produces no neutron
=== intermediate-energy neutronsedit ===
a fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron
cross sections for both capture and fission reactions often have multiple resonance peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range these are of less significance in a fast neutron reactor where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range or in a well-moderated thermal reactor where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei not with either fissile or fertile actinide nuclides however in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei there are greater possibilities for transient changes in reactivity that might make reactor control more difficult
ratios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most nuclear fuels such as plutonium-239 making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a nuclide that is not fissile with thermal or epithermal neutrons though still fissionable with fast neutrons the exception is uranium-233 of the thorium cycle which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies
=== high-energy neutronsedit ===
these neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by particle accelerators or in the atmosphere from cosmic rays they can have energies as high as tens of joules per neutron these neutrons are extremely efficient at ionization and far more likely to cause cell death than x-rays or protons
