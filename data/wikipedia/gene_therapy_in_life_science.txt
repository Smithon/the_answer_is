gene therapy is the therapeutic delivery of nucleic acid polymers into a patient's cells as a drug to treat disease until september 1990 it had never been successfully done and it is still an experimental and emerging medical technology that has seen new promise in the 2010s after extensive challenges and setbacks in the first two decades of its existence
between september 1990 and january 2014 some 2,000 clinical trials had been conducted or approved
it should be noted that not all medical procedures that introduce alterations to a patient's genetic makeup can be considered gene therapy bone marrow transplantation and organ transplants in general have been found to introduce foreign dna into patients gene therapy is defined by the precision of the procedure and the intention of direct therapeutic effects
== background ==
gene therapy was conceptualized in 1972 by authors who urged caution before commencing human gene therapy studies
the first attempt albeit an unsuccessful one at gene therapy (as well as the first case of medical transfer of foreign genes into humans not counting organ transplantation) was performed by martin cline on 10 july 1980 cline claimed that one of the genes in his patients was active six months later though he never published this data or had it verified and even if he is correct it's unlikely it produced any significant beneficial effects treating beta-thalassemia
after extensive research on animals throughout the 1980s and a 1989 bacterial gene tagging trial on humans the first gene therapy widely accepted as a success was demonstrated in a trial that started on september 14 1990 when ashi desilva was treated for ada-scid
the first somatic treatment that produced a permanent genetic change was performed in 1993
the first germ line gene therapy consisted of producing a genetically engineered embryo in october 1996 the baby was born on july 21 1997 and was produced by taking a donor's egg with healthy mitochondria removing its nuclear dna and filling it with the nuclear dna of the biological mother - a procedure known as cytoplasmic transfer
this procedure was referred to sensationally and somewhat inaccurately in the media as a "three parent baby" though mtdna is not the primary human genome and has little effect on an organism's individual characteristics beyond powering their cells
gene therapy is a way to fix a genetic problem at its source the polymers are either expressed as proteins interfere with protein expression or possibly correct genetic mutations
the most common form uses dna that encodes a functional therapeutic gene to replace a mutated gene the polymer molecule is packaged within a "vector" which carries the molecule inside cells
early clinical failures led to dismissals of gene therapy clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention although as of 2014 it was still largely an experimental technique these include treatment of retinal disease leber's congenital amaurosis x-linked scid ada-scid adrenoleukodystrophy chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) acute lymphocytic leukemia (all) multiple myeloma haemophilia and parkinson's disease between 2013 and april 2014 us companies invested over $600 million in the field
the first commercial gene therapy gendicine was approved in china in 2003 for the treatment of certain cancers in 2011 neovasculgen was registered in russia as the first-in-class gene-therapy drug for treatment of peripheral artery disease including critical limb ischemia in 2012 glybera a treatment for a rare inherited disorder became the first treatment to be approved for clinical use in either europe or the united states after its endorsement by the european commission
== approaches ==
following early advances in genetic engineering of bacteria cells and small animals scientists started considering how to apply it to medicine two main approaches were considered replacing or disrupting defective genes scientists focused on diseases caused by single-gene defects such as cystic fibrosis haemophilia muscular dystrophy thalassemia and sickle cell anemia glybera treats one such disease caused by a defect in lipoprotein lipase
dna must be administered reach the damaged cells enter the cell and express/disrupt a protein multiple delivery techniques have been explored the initial approach incorporated dna into an engineered virus to deliver the dna into a chromosome naked dna approaches have also been explored especially in the context of vaccine development
generally efforts focused on administering a gene that causes a needed protein to be expressed more recently increased understanding of nuclease function has led to more direct dna editing using techniques such as zinc finger nucleases and crispr the vector incorporates genes into chromosomes the expressed nucleases then "edit" the chromosome as of 2014 these approaches involve removing cells from patients editing a chromosome and returning the transformed cells to patients
other technologies employ antisense small interfering rna and other dna to the extent that these technologies do not alter dna but instead directly interact with molecules such as rna they are not considered "gene therapy" per se
== cell types ==
gene therapy may be classified into two types:
=== somatic cell ===
in somatic cell gene therapy (scgt) the therapeutic genes are transferred into any of any cell other than a gamete germ cell gametocyte or undifferentiated stem cell any such modifications affect the individual patient only and are not inherited by offspring somatic gene therapy represents mainstream basic and clinical research in which therapeutic dna (either integrated in the genome or as an external episome or plasmid) is used to treat disease
over 600 clinical trials utilizing scgt are underway in the us most focus on severe genetic disorders including immunodeficiencies haemophilia thalassaemia and cystic fibrosis such single gene disorders are good candidates for somatic cell therapy the complete correction of a genetic disorder or the replacement of multiple genes is not yet possible only a few of the trials are in the advanced stages
=== germline ===
in germline gene therapy (ggt) germ cells (sperm or eggs) are modified by the introduction of functional genes into their genomes modifying a germ cell causes all the organism's cells to contain the modified gene the change is therefore heritable and passed on to later generations australia canada germany israel switzerland and the netherlands prohibit ggt for application in human beings for technical and ethical reasons including insufficient knowledge about possible risks to future generations and higher risks versus scgt the us has no federal controls specifically addressing human genetic modification (beyond fda regulations for therapies in general)
== vectors ==
the delivery of dna into cells can be accomplished by multiple methods the two major classes are recombinant viruses (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and naked dna or dna complexes (non-viral methods)
=== viruses ===
in order to replicate viruses introduce their genetic material into the host cell tricking the host's cellular machinery into using it as blueprints for viral proteins scientists exploit this by substituting a virus's genetic material with therapeutic dna (the term 'dna' may be an oversimplification as some viruses contain rna and gene therapy could take this form as well.) a number of viruses have been used for human gene therapy including retrovirus adenovirus lentivirus herpes simplex vaccinia and adeno-associated virus like the genetic material (dna or rna) in viruses therapeutic dna can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that is degraded naturally or (at least theoretically) to enter the host's genome becoming a permanent part of the host's dna in infected cells
=== non-viral ===
non-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods such as large scale production and low host immunogenicity however non-viral methods initially produced lower levels of transfection and gene expression and thus lower therapeutic efficacy later technology remedied this deficiency
methods for non-viral gene therapy include the injection of naked dna electroporation the gene gun sonoporation magnetofection the use of oligonucleotides lipoplexes dendrimers and inorganic nanoparticles
== hurdles ==
some of the unsolved problems include:
short-lived nature before gene therapy can become a permanent cure for a condition the therapeutic dna introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells containing the therapeutic dna must be stable problems with integrating therapeutic dna into the genome and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent it from achieving long-term benefits patients require multiple treatments
immune response any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues the immune system is stimulated to attack the invader stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is possible the immune system's enhanced response to viruses that it has seen before reduces the effectiveness to repeated treatments
problems with viral vectors viral vectors carry the risks of toxicity inflammatory responses and gene control and targeting issues
multigene disorders some commonly occurring disorders such as heart disease high blood pressure alzheimer's disease arthritis and diabetes are affected by variations in multiple genes which complicate gene therapy
some therapies may breach the weismann barrier (between soma and germ-line) protecting the testes potentially modifying the germline falling afoul of regulations in countries that prohibit the latter practice
insertional mutagenesis if the dna is integrated in a sensitive spot in the genome for example in a tumor suppressor gene the therapy could induce a tumor this has occurred in clinical trials for x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (x-scid) patients in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus and this led to the development of t cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients one possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the dna to be integrated this may be problematic since the longer the dna is the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes crispr technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations
cost alipogene tiparvovec or glybera for example at a cost of $1.6 million per patient was reported in 2013 to be the world's most expensive drug
=== deaths ===
three patients' deaths have been reported in gene therapy trials putting the field under close scrutiny the first was that of jesse gelsinger in 1999 one x-scid patient died of leukemia in 2003 in 2007 a rheumatoid arthritis patient died from an infection; the subsequent investigation concluded that the death was not related to gene therapy
== history ==
=== 1970s and earlier ===
in 1972 friedmann and roblin authored a paper in science titled "gene therapy for human genetic disease?" rogers (1970) was cited for proposing that exogenous good dna be used to replace the defective dna in those who suffer from genetic defects
=== 1980s ===
in 1984 a retrovirus vector system was designed that could efficiently insert foreign genes into mammalian chromosomes
=== 1990s ===
the first approved gene therapy in the us took place on 14 september 1990 at the national institutes of health (nih) under the direction of william french anderson four-year-old ashanti desilva received treatment for a genetic defect that left her with ada-scid a severe immune system deficiency the effects were temporary but successful
cancer gene therapy was introduced in 1992/93 the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme the malignant brain tumor whose outcome is always fatal was done using a vector expressing antisense igf-i rna (clinical trial approved by nih n 1602 and fda in 1994) the therapy proved to be effective due to the anti-tumor mechanism of igf-i antisense which is related to strong immune and apoptotic phenomena for this reason this strategy can be considered also as immunotherapy
in 1992 claudio bordignon working at the vita-salute san raffaele university performed the first gene therapy procedure using hematopoietic stem cells as vectors to deliver genes intended to correct hereditary diseases in 2002 this work led to the publication of the first successful gene therapy treatment for adenosine deaminase-deficiency (scid) the success of a multi-center trial for treating children with scid (severe combined immune deficiency or "bubble boy" disease) from 2000 and 2002 was questioned when two of the ten children treated at the trial's paris center developed a leukemia-like condition clinical trials were halted temporarily in 2002 but resumed after regulatory review of the protocol in the us the united kingdom france italy and germany
in 1993 andrew gobea was born with scid following prenatal genetic screening blood was removed from his mother's placenta and umbilical cord immediately after birth to acquire stem cells the allele that codes for adenosine deaminase (ada) was obtained and inserted into a retrovirus retroviruses and stem cells were mixed after which the viruses inserted the gene into the stem cell chromosomes stem cells containing the working ada gene were injected into andrew's blood injections of the ada enzyme were also given weekly for four years t cells (white blood cells) produced by stem cells made ada enzymes using the ada gene after four years more treatment was needed
jesse gelsinger's death in 1999 impeded gene therapy research in the us as a result the fda suspended several clinical trials pending the reevaluation of ethical and procedural practices
=== 2000s ===
the modified cancer gene therapy strategy of antisense igf-i rna (nih n 1602) using antisense / triple helix anti igf-i approach was registered in 2002 by wiley gene therapy clinical trial - n 635 and 636 the approach has shown promising results in the treatment of six different malignant tumors: glioblastoma cancers of liver colon prostate uterus and ovary (collaborative nato science programme on gene therapy usa france poland n lst 980517 conducted by j trojan) (trojan et al. 2012) this antigene antisense/triple helix therapy has proven to be efficient due to the mechanism stopping simultaneously igf-i expression on translation and transcription levels strengthening anti-tumor immune and apoptotic phenomenons (trojan et al. 2013)
==== 2002 ====
sickle-cell disease can be treated in mice the mice which have essentially the same defect that causes human cases used a viral vector to induce production of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) which normally ceases to be produced shortly after birth in humans the use of hydroxyurea to stimulate the production of hbf temporarily alleviates sickle cell symptoms the researchers demonstrated this treatment to be a more permanent means to increase therapeutic hbf production

== speculative uses ==
speculated uses for gene therapy include:
=== fertility ===
gene therapy techniques have the potential to provide alternative treatments for those with infertility recently successful experimentation on mice has proven that fertility can be restored by using the gene therapy method crispr spermatogenical stem cells from another organism were transplanted into the testes of an infertile male mouse the stem cells re-established spermatogenesis and fertility gene therapy research on fertility is promising and scientists anticipate that this method can be further utilized to help humans in the near future

=== gene doping ===
athletes might adopt gene therapy technologies to improve their performance gene doping is not known to occur but multiple gene therapies may have such effects kayser et al argue that gene doping could level the playing field if all athletes receive equal access critics claim that any therapeutic intervention for non-therapeutic/enhancement purposes compromises the ethical foundations of medicine and sports
=== human genetic engineering ===
genetic engineering could be used to change physical appearance metabolism and even improve physical capabilities and mental faculties such as memory and intelligence ethical claims about germline engineering include beliefs that every fetus has a right to remain genetically unmodified that parents hold such rights and that every child has the right to be born free of preventable diseases for adults genetic engineering could be seen as another enhancement technique to add to diet exercise education cosmetics and plastic surgery another theorist claims that moral concerns limit but do not prohibit germline engineering
possible regulatory schemes include a complete ban provision to everyone or professional self-regulation the american medical associations council on ethical and judicial affairs stated that "genetic interventions to enhance traits should be considered permissible only in severely restricted situations: (1) clear and meaningful benefits to the fetus or child; (2) no trade-off with other characteristics or traits; and (3) equal access to the genetic technology irrespective of income or other socioeconomic characteristics."
as early in the history of biotechnology as 1990 the scientific community was opposed to attempts to modify the human germline using these new tools and such cautions continued as technology progressed with the advent of new techniques like crispr in march 2015 scientists urged a worldwide ban on clinical use of gene editing technologies to edit the human genome in a way that can be inherited in april 2015 researchers sparked controversy when they reported results of basic research to edit the dna of non-viable human embryos using crispr additionally it has been suggested that 3d printing can be implemented in the rapid development of "bioresorbable scaffolds" capable of implanting stem cells
== regulations ==
regulations covering genetic modification are part of general guidelines about human-involved biomedical research
the helsinki declaration (ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects) was amended by the world medical association's general assembly in 2008 this document provides principles physicians and researchers must consider when involving humans as research subjects the statement on gene therapy research initiated by the human genome organization (hugo) in 2001 provides a legal baseline for all countries hugos document emphasizes human freedom and adherence to human rights and offers recommendations for somatic gene therapy including the importance of recognizing public concerns about such research
=== united states ===
no federal legislation lays out protocols or restrictions about human genetic engineering this subject is governed by overlapping regulations from local and federal agencies including the department of health and human services the fda and nih's recombinant dna advisory committee researchers seeking federal funds for an investigational new drug application (commonly the case for somatic human genetic engineering) must obey international and federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects
nih serves as the main gene therapy regulator for federally funded research privately funded research is advised to follow these regulations nih provides funding for research that develops or enhances genetic engineering techniques and to evaluate the ethics and quality in current research the nih maintains a mandatory registry of human genetic engineering research protocols that includes all federally funded projects
an nih advisory committee published a set of guidelines on gene manipulation the guidelines discuss lab safety as well as human test subjects and various experimental types that involve genetic changes several sections specifically pertain to human genetic engineering including section iii-c-1 this section describes required review processes and other aspects when seeking approval to begin clinical research involving genetic transfer into a human patient
the fda regulates the quality and safety of gene therapy products and supervises how these products are used clinically therapeutic alteration of the human genome falls under the same regulatory requirements as any other medical treatment research involving human subjects such as clinical trials must be reviewed and approved by the fda and an institutional review board
