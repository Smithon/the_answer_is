the apicomplexa (also called apicomplexia) are a large phylum of parasitic protists most of them possess a unique form of organelle that comprises a type of plastid called an apicoplast and an apical complex structure the organelle is an adaptation that the apicomplexan applies in penetration of a host cell
the apicomplexa are unicellular and spore-forming all species are obligate endoparasites of animals except nephromyces a symbiont in marine animals originally classified as a chytrid fungus motile structures such as flagella or pseudopods are present only in certain gamete stages
the apicomplexa are a diverse group that includes organisms such as the coccidia gregarines piroplasms haemogregarines and plasmodia diseased caused by apicomplexa include:
babesiosis (babesia)
malaria (plasmodium)
cryptosporidiosis (cryptosporidium parvum)
cyclosporiasis (cyclospora cayetanensis)
isosporiasis (isospora belli)
toxoplasmosis (toxoplasma gondii)
the name of the taxon apicomplexa derives from two latin words apex (top) and complexus (infolds) and refers to a set of organelles in the sporozoite the apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the sporozoa a group of parasitic protozoans in general without flagella cilia or pseudopods most of the apicomplexa are motile however by use of a gliding mechanism that uses adhesions and small static myosin motors the other main lines were the ascetosporea (now in rhizaria) the myxozoa (now known to be derived from animals) and the microsporidia (now known to be derived from fungi) sometimes the name sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the apicomplexa or occasionally as a subset
== general features of the apicomplexaedit ==
all members of this phylum have an infectious stage the sporozoite which possesses three distinct structures in an apical complex the apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged microtubules (the conoid) a secretory body (the rhoptry) and one or more polar rings additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies (micronemes) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present this structure gives the phylum its name
a further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the apical complex and are known as the dense granules these typically have a mean diameter of about 0.7 m secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the parasitophorous vacuole and persists for several minutes
other morphological findings that are common to all members of this phylum include:
the nucleus is haploid
flagella are found only in the motile gamete these are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three)
basal bodies are present although hemosporidians and piroplasmids have normal triplets of microtubules in their basal bodies coccidians and gregarines have nine singlets
the mitochondria have tubular cristae
a golgi apparatus is present
centrioles chloroplasts ejectile organelles and inclusions are absent
colourless plastids are present in some species
the cell is surrounded by a pellicle of three membrane layers (the alveolar structure) penetrated by micropores
replication:
mitosis is usually closed with an intranuclear spindle; in some species it is open at the poles
cell division is usually by schizogony
meiosis occurs in the zygote
mobility:
apicomplexans have a unique gliding capability which enables them to cross through tissues and enter and leave their host cells this gliding ability is made possible by the use of adhesions and small static myosin motors
other features common to this phylum are a lack of cilia sexual reproduction use of micropores for feeding and the production of oocysts containing sporozoites as the infective form
most apicomplexans have an apicoplast (a nonphotosynthetic plastid) and mitochondrial and nuclear genomes although cryptosporidium species and gregarines are possible exceptions as they are thought to have lost their plastids after the diverging last common ancestor of apicomplexans
== general features of the subgroupsedit ==
within this phylum are three groups coccidians gregarines and haemosporidians the coccidians and gregarines appear to be relatively closely related
perkinsus  while once considered a member of the apicomplexa has been moved to a new phylum perkinsozoa
=== gregarinesedit ===
the gregarines are generally parasites of annelids arthropods and mollusks they are often found in the guts of their hosts but may invade the other tissues in the typical gregarine lifecycle a trophozoite develops within a host cell into a schizont this then divides into a number of merozoites by schizogony the merozoites are released by lysing the host cell which in turn invade other cells at some point in the apicomplexan lifecycle gametocytes are formed these are released by lysis of the host cells which group together each gametocyte forms multiple gametes the gametes fuse with another to form oocysts the oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host
=== coccidiansedit ===
in general coccidians are parasites of vertebrates like gregarines they are commonly parasites of the epithelial cells of the gut but may infect other tissues
the coccidian lifecycle involves merogony gametogony and sporogony while similar to that of the gregarines it differs in zygote formation some trophozoites enlarge and become macrogamete whereas others divide repeatedly to form microgametes (anisogamy) the microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it the fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote that in its turn forms an oocyst that is normally released from the body syzygy when it occurs involves markedly anisogamous gametes the lifecycle is typically haploid with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote which is normally short-lived
the main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts in the coccida these are small intracellular and without epimerites or mucrons in the gregarines these are large extracellular and possess epimerites or mucrons a second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts in the coccidian a single gamont becomes a macrogametocyte whereas in the gregarines the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes
=== haemosporidiaedit ===
the haemosporidia have more complex lifecycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host the trophozoite parasitises erythrocytes or other tissues in the vertebrate host microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood the gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal the microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes the fertilized macrogamete now becomes an ookinete which penetrates the body of the vector the ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis (haplontic lifecycle) to give rise to the sporozoites the sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again
== reproduction and lifecycleedit ==
most members have a complex lifecycle involving both asexual and sexual reproduction typically a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to entosis) which divide to produce sporozoites that enter its cells eventually the cells burst releasing merozoites which infect new cells this may occur several times until gamonts are produced forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts many variations occur on this basic pattern however and many apicomplexa have more than one host
the apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries and micronemes which open at the anterior of the cell these secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells the tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules called the polar ring and among the conoidasida is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid over the rest of the cell except for a diminished mouth called the micropore the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli forming a semirigid pellicle
the presence of alveoli and other traits place the apicomplexa among a group called the alveolates several related flagellates such as perkinsus and colpodella have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates they are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups
another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single plastid called the apicoplast surrounded by either three or four membranes its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis and it appears to be necessary for survival in general plastids are considered to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates and evidence points to an origin from red algae rather than green
== parasitology and genomicsedit ==
many of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals in contrast to bacterial pathogens these apicomplexan parasites are eukaryotic and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts this makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host at present no effective vaccines are available for most diseases caused by these parasites biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult if not impossible to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms in recent years several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for genome sequencing the availability of genome sequences provides a new opportunity for scientists to learn more about the evolution and biochemical capacity of these parasites the predominant source of this genomic information is the eupathdb family of websites which currently provides specialised services for plasmodium species (plasmodb) coccidians (toxodb) piroplasms (piroplasmadb) and cryptosporidium species (cryptodb).> one possible target for drugs is the plastid and in fact existing drugs such as tetracyclines which are effective against apicomplexans seem to operate against the plastid
=== blood-borne generaedit ===
within the apicomplexa are three suborders of parasites:
suborder adeleorina eight genera
suborder haemosporina all genera in this suborder
suborder eimeriorina two genera (lankesterella and schellackia)
within the adelorina are species that infect invertebrates and others that infect vertebrates the eimeriorina the largest suborder in this phylum the lifecycle involves both sexual and asexual stages the asexual stages reproduce by schizogony the male gametocyte produces a large number of gametes and the zygote gives rise to an oocyst which is the infective stage the majority are monoxenous (infect one host only) but a few are heteroxenous (lifecycle involves two or more hosts)
the number of families in this later suborder is debated with the number of families being between one and 20 depending on the authority and the number of genera being between 19 and 25
== evolutionedit ==
all members of this phylum are parasitic and evolved from a free-living ancestor this lifestyle is presumed to have evolved at the time of the divergence of dinoagellates and apicomplexans further evolution of this phylum has been estimated to have occurred about 800 million years ago the oldest extant clade is thought to be the archigregarines
many coccidiomorpha have an intermediate host as well as a primary host and the evolution of hosts proceeded in different ways and at different times in these groups for some coccidiomorphs the original host has become the intermediate host whereas in others it has become the definitive host in the genera aggregata atoxoplasma cystoisospora schellackia and toxoplasma the original is now definitive whereas in akiba babesiosoma babesia haemogregarina haemoproteus hepatozoon karyolysus leucocytozoon plasmodium sarcocystis and theileria the original hosts are now intermediate
similar strategies to increase the likelihood of transmission have evolved in multiple genera polyenergid oocysts and tissue cysts are found in representatives of the orders protococcidiorida and eimeriida hypnozoites are found in karyolysus lacerate and most species of plasmodium; transovarial transmission of parasites occurs in lifecycles of karyolysus and babesia
horizontal gene transfer appears to have occurred early on in this phylum's evolution with the transfer of a histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20) modifier set8 from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans a second gene h3k36 methyltransferase (ashr3 in plants) may have also be horizontally transferred
=== phylogenetic relationsedit ===
this has rarely been studied at the subclass level the haemosporidia are related to the gregarines and the piroplasms and coccidians are sister groups the haemosporidia and the piroplasma appear to be sister clades and are more closely related to the coccidians than to the gregarines
transposons appear to be rare in this phylum but have been identified in the genera ascogregarina and eimeria
== taxonomyedit ==
=== historyedit ===
the first apicomplexa protozoan was seen by antonie van leeuwenhoek who in 1674 saw oocysts of eimeria stiedae in the gall bladder of a rabbit the first member of the phylum to be named (by dufour in 1828) was gregarina ovata in earwigs since then many more have been identified and named during 18261850 41 species and six genera of apicomplexa were named in 19511975 1873 new species and 83 new genera were added
the older taxon sporozoa was created by leuckart in 1879 and adopted by btschli in 1880 through history it grouped with the current apicomplexa many unrelated groups for example kudo (1954) included in the sporozoa species of the ascetosporea (rhizaria) microsporidia (fungi) myxozoa (animalia) and helicosporidium (chlorophyta) while zierdt (1978) included the genus blastocystis (stramenopiles) sporozoa is no longer regarded as biologically valid and its use is discouraged although some authors still use it as a synonym for the apicomplexa more recently other groups were excluded from apicomplexa e.g. perkinsus and colpodella (now in protalveolata)
the field of classifying apicomplexa is in flux and classification has changed throughout the years since it was formally named in 1970
by 1987 a comprehensive survey of the phylum was completed: in all 4516 species and 339 genera had been named they consisted of:
subclass gregarinasida with 1624 named species and 231 named genera
family haemogregarinidae with 399 species and four genera
order eimeriorida with 1771 species and 43 genera
order haemosporasina with 444 species and nine genera
order piroplasmorida with 173 species and 20 genera
others (105 species and 32 genera)
although considerable revision of this phylum has been done (the order haemosporidia now has 17 genera rather than 9) these numbers seems likely to be still approximately correct
=== jacques euzby (1988)edit ===
jacques euzby in 1988 created a new class haemosporidiasina by merging subclass piroplasmasina and suborder haemospororina
subclass gregarinasina (the gregarines)
subclass coccidiasina
suborder adeleorina (the adeleorins)
suborder eimeriorina (the eimeriorins)
subclass haemosporidiasina
order achromatorida
order chromatorida
the division into achromatorida and chromatorida although proposed on morphological grounds may have a biological basis as the ability to store haemozoin appears to have evolved only once
=== roberts and janovy (1996)edit ===
roberts and janovy in 1996 divided the phylum into the following subclasses and suborders (omitting classes and orders):
subclass gregarinasina (the gregarines)
subclass coccidiasina
suborder adeleorina (the adeleorins)
suborder eimeriorina (the eimeriorins)
suborder haemospororina (the haemospororins)
subclass piroplasmasina (the piroplasms)
these form the following five taxonomic groups:
the gregarines are in general one-host parasites of invertebrates
the adeleorins are one-host parasites of invertebrates or vertebrates or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and the blood of vertebrates
the eimeriorins are a diverse group that includes one host species of invertebrates two-host species of invertebrates one-host species of vertebrates and two-host species of vertebrates the eimeriorins are frequently called the coccidia this term is often used to include the adeleorins
haemospororins often known as the malaria parasites are two-host apicomplexa that parasitize blood-feeding dipteran flies and the blood of various tetrapod vertebrates
piroplasms where all the species included are two-host parasites infecting ticks and vertebrates
=== perkins (2000)edit ===
this scheme is taken from perkins et al it is outdated as the perkinsidae have since been recognised as a sister group to the dinoflagellates rather that the apicomplexia the remainder of the scheme appears to be valid:
class aconoidasida
conoid present only in the ookinete of some species
order haemospororida
macrogamete and microgamete develop separately syzygy does not occur ookinete has a conoid sporozoites have three walls heteroxenous: alternates between vertebrate host (in which merogony occurs) and invertebrate host (in which sporogony occurs) usually blood parasites transmitted by blood-sucking insects
order piroplasmorida
class conoidasida
subclass gregarinasina
order archigregarinorida
order eugregarinorida
suborder adeleorina
suborder eimeriorina
order neogregarinorida
subclass coccidiasina
order agamococcidiorida
order eucoccidiorida
order ixorheorida
order protococcidiorida
class perkinsasida
order perkinsorida
family perkinsidae
the name protospiromonadida has been proposed for the common ancestor of the gregarinomorpha and coccidiomorpha
