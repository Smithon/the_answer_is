particle physics is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter (particles with mass) and radiation (massless particles) although the word "particle" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g protons gas particles or even household dust) "particle physics" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them by our current understanding these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions the currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields along with their dynamics is called the standard model thus modern particle physics generally investigates the standard model and its various possible extensions e.g to the newest "known" particle the higgs boson or even to the oldest known force field gravity
== subatomic particles ==
modern particle physics research is focused on subatomic particles including atomic constituents such as electrons protons and neutrons (protons and neutrons are composite particles called baryons made of quarks) produced by radioactive and scattering processes such as photons neutrinos and muons as well as a wide range of exotic particles dynamics of particles is also governed by quantum mechanics; they exhibit waveparticle duality displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and wave-like behaviour in others in more technical terms they are described by quantum state vectors in a hilbert space which is also treated in quantum field theory following the convention of particle physicists the term elementary particles is applied to those particles that are according to current understanding presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles
all particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by a quantum field theory called the standard model the standard model as currently formulated has 61 elementary particles those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s the standard model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date however most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (see theory of everything) in recent years measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the standard model
== history ==
the idea that all matter is composed of elementary particles dates to at least the 6th century bc in the 19th century john dalton through his work on stoichiometry concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single unique type of particle the word atom after the greek word atomos meaning "indivisible" denotes the smallest particle of a chemical element since then but physicists soon discovered that atoms are not in fact the fundamental particles of nature but conglomerates of even smaller particles such as the electron the early 20th-century explorations of nuclear physics and quantum physics culminated in proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by lise meitner (based on experiments by otto hahn) and nuclear fusion by hans bethe in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of nuclear weapons throughout the 1950s and 1960s a bewildering variety of particles were found in scattering experiments it was referred to as the "particle zoo" that term was deprecated after the formulation of the standard model during the 1970s in which the large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of fundamental particles
== standard model ==
the current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the standard model it describes the strong weak and electromagnetic fundamental interactions using mediating gauge bosons the species of gauge bosons are the gluons w w+ and z bosons and the photons the standard model also contains 24 fundamental particles (12 particles and their associated anti-particles) which are the constituents of all matter finally the standard model also predicted the existence of a type of boson known as the higgs boson early in the morning on 4 july 2012 physicists with the large hadron collider at cern announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the higgs boson
== experimental laboratories ==
in particle physics the major international laboratories are located at the:
brookhaven national laboratory (long island united states) its main facility is the relativistic heavy ion collider (rhic) which collides heavy ions such as gold ions and polarized protons it is the world's first heavy ion collider and the world's only polarized proton collider
budker institute of nuclear physics (novosibirsk russia) its main projects are now the electron-positron colliders vepp-2000 operated since 2006 and vepp-4 started experiments in 1994 earlier facilities include the first electron-electron beam-beam collider vep-1 which conducted experiments from 1964 to 1968; the electron-positron colliders vepp-2 operated from 1965 to 1974; and its successor vepp-2m performed experiments from 1974 to 2000
cern (conseil europen pour la recherche nuclaire) (franco-swiss border near geneva) its main project is now the large hadron collider (lhc) which had its first beam circulation on 10 september 2008 and is now the world's most energetic collider of protons it also became the most energetic collider of heavy ions after it began colliding lead ions earlier facilities include the large electronpositron collider (lep) which was stopped on 2 november 2000 and then dismantled to give way for lhc; and the super proton synchrotron which is being reused as a pre-accelerator for the lhc
desy (deutsches elektronen-synchrotron) (hamburg germany) its main facility is the hadron elektron ring anlage (hera) which collides electrons and positrons with protons
fermi national accelerator laboratory (fermilab) (batavia united states) its main facility until 2011 was the tevatron which collided protons and antiprotons and was the highest-energy particle collider on earth until the large hadron collider surpassed it on 29 november 2009
kek (tsukuba japan) it is the home of a number of experiments such as the k2k experiment a neutrino oscillation experiment and belle an experiment measuring the cp violation of b mesons
slac national accelerator laboratory (menlo park united states) its 2-mile-long linear particle accelerator began operating in 1962 and was the basis for numerous electron and positron collision experiments until 2008 since then the linear accelerator is being used for the linac coherent light source x-ray laser as well as advanced accelerator design research slac staff continue to participate in developing and building many particle physics experiments around the world
many other particle accelerators do exist
the techniques required to do modern experimental particle physics are quite varied and complex constituting a sub-specialty nearly completely distinct from the theoretical side of the field
== theory ==
theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models theoretical framework and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments see also theoretical physics there are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today one important branch attempts to better understand the standard model and its tests by extracting the parameters of the standard model from experiments with less uncertainty this work probes the limits of the standard model and therefore expands our understanding of nature's building blocks those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating quantities in quantum chromodynamics some theorists working in this area refer to themselves as phenomenologists and they may use the tools of quantum field theory and effective field theory others make use of lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theorists
another major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the standard model (at higher energies or smaller distances) this work is often motivated by the hierarchy problem and is constrained by existing experimental data it may involve work on supersymmetry alternatives to the higgs mechanism extra spatial dimensions (such as the randall-sundrum models) preon theory combinations of these or other ideas
a third major effort in theoretical particle physics is string theory string theorists attempt to construct a unified description of quantum mechanics and general relativity by building a theory based on small strings and branes rather than particles if the theory is successful it may be considered a "theory of everything" or "toe"
there are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology to loop quantum gravity
this division of efforts in particle physics is reflected in the names of categories on the arxiv a preprint archive: hep-th (theory) hep-ph (phenomenology) hep-ex (experiments) hep-lat (lattice gauge theory)
== practical applications ==
in principle all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles in practice even if "particle physics" is taken to mean only "high-energy atom smashers" many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society cyclotrons are used to produce medical isotopes for research and treatment (for example isotopes used in pet imaging) or used directly for certain cancer treatments the development of superconductors has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics the world wide web and touchscreen technology were initially developed at cern
additional applications are found in medicine national security industry computing science and workforce development illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics
== future ==
the primary goal which is pursued in several distinct ways is to find and understand what physics may lie beyond the standard model there are several powerful experimental reasons to expect new physics including dark matter and neutrino mass there are also theoretical hints that this new physics should be found at accessible energy scales
much of the effort to find this new physics are focused on new collider experiments the large hadron collider (lhc) was completed in 2008 to help continue the search for the higgs boson supersymmetric particles and other new physics an intermediate goal is the construction of the international linear collider (ilc) which will complement the lhc by allowing more precise measurements of the properties of newly found particles in august 2004 a decision for the technology of the ilc was taken but the site has still to be agreed upon
in addition there are important non-collider experiments that also attempt to find and understand physics beyond the standard model one important non-collider effort is the determination of the neutrino masses since these masses may arise from neutrinos mixing with very heavy particles in addition cosmological observations provide many useful constraints on the dark matter although it may be impossible to determine the exact nature of the dark matter without the colliders finally lower bounds on the very long lifetime of the proton put constraints on grand unified theories at energy scales much higher than collider experiments will be able to probe any time soon
in may 2014 the particle physics project prioritization panel released its report on particle physics funding priorities for the united states over the next decade this report emphasized continued u.s participation in the lhc and ilc and expansion of the long baseline neutrino experiment among other recommendations
