a tsunami (plural tsunamis or tsunami from japanese  lit harbor wave english pronunciation /tsunmi/)  also known as a seismic sea wave is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water generally in an ocean or a large lake earthquakes volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices) landslides glacier calvings meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami unlike normal ocean waves which are generated by wind or tides which are generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water
tsunami waves do not resemble normal sea waves because their wavelength is far longer rather than appearing as a breaking wave a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide and for this reason they are often referred to as tidal waves although this usage is not favored by the scientific community because tsunamis are not tidal in nature tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours arriving in a so-called wave train wave heights of tens of meters can be generated by large events although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins the 2004 indian ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the indian ocean
the greek historian thucydides suggested in his late-5th century bc history of the peloponnesian war that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes but the understanding of a tsunami's nature remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown major areas of current research include trying to determine why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do trying to accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across the oceans and also to forecast how tsunami waves interact with specific shorelines
== terminologyedit ==
numerous terms are used in the english language to describe waves created in a body of water by the displacement of water however none of the terms in frequent use are entirely accurate
=== tsunamiedit ===
the term tsunami meaning harbor wave in literal translation comes from the japanese  composed of the two kanji (tsu) meaning harbor and (nami) meaning wave (for the plural one can either follow ordinary english practice and add an s or use an invariable plural as in the japanese.)
there are only a few other languages that have an equivalent native word in acehnese the words are i beuna or aln buluk (depending on the dialect) in tamil it is aazhi peralai on simeulue island off the western coast of sumatra in indonesia in devayan the word is smong while in sigulai it is emong
in singkil (in aceh province) and surrounding areas the people use the word gloro/galoro for tsunami in nias it is called oloro/galoro and in ende it is called ae mesi nuka tana lala
in spanish and portuguese the term used is marmoto, literally the sea moves, and these are often associated with terramotos otherwise known as earthquakes. residents of many coastal areas where spanish or portuguese is spoken know that if they feel a terramoto they should seek high ground in case a marmoto occurs
=== tidal waveedit ===
tsunami are sometimes referred to as tidal waves this once-popular term derives from the most common appearance of tsunami which is that of an extraordinarily high tidal bore tsunami and tides both produce waves of water that move inland but in the case of tsunami the inland movement of water may be much greater giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide in recent years the term tidal wave has fallen out of favor especially in the scientific community because tsunami actually have nothing to do with tides which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water although the meanings of tidal include resembling or having the form or character of the tides use of the term tidal wave is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers
=== seismic sea waveedit ===
the term seismic sea wave also is used to refer to the phenomenon because the waves most often are generated by seismic activity such as earthquakes prior to the rise of the use of the term tsunami in english-speaking countries scientists generally encouraged the use of the term seismic sea wave rather than the inaccurate term tidal wave. however like tsunami, seismic sea wave is not a completely accurate term as forces other than earthquakes including underwater landslides volcanic eruptions underwater explosions land or ice slumping into the ocean meteorite impacts or even the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly can generate such waves by displacing water
== historyedit ==
while japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis the sheer destruction caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times killing around 230,000 people the sumatran region is not unused to tsunamis either with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island
tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the mediterranean sea region and europe in general of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are e.g the 1755 lisbon earthquake and tsunami (which was caused by the azoresgibraltar transform fault) the 1783 calabrian earthquakes each causing several ten thousand deaths and the 1908 messina earthquake and tsunami the tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in sicily and calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern europe the storegga slide in the norwegian sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the british isles refer to landslide and meteotsunamis predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves
as early as 426 bc the greek historian thucydides inquired in his book history of the peloponnesian war about the causes of tsunami and was the first to argue that ocean earthquakes must be the cause
the cause in my opinion of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake at the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force causes the inundation without an earthquake i do not see how such an accident could happen.
the roman historian ammianus marcellinus (res gestae 26.10.15-19) described the typical sequence of a tsunami including an incipient earthquake the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave after the 365 ad tsunami devastated alexandria
== generation mechanismsedit ==
the principal generation mechanism (or cause) of a tsunami is the displacement of a substantial volume of water or perturbation of the sea this displacement of water is usually attributed to either earthquakes landslides volcanic eruptions glacier calvings or more rarely by meteorites and nuclear tests the waves formed in this way are then sustained by gravity tides do not play any part in the generation of tsunamis
=== seismicityedit ===
tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water tectonic earthquakes are a particular kind of earthquake that are associated with the earth's crustal deformation when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position more specifically a tsunami can be generated when thrust faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move abruptly resulting in water displacement owing to the vertical component of movement involved movement on normal (extensional) faults can also cause displacement of the seabed but only the largest of such events (typically related to flexure in the outer trench swell) cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami such as the 1977 sumba and 1933 sanriku events
tsunamis have a small amplitude (wave height) offshore and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long whereas normal ocean waves have a wavelength of only 30 or 40 metres) which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea forming only a slight swell usually about 300 millimetres (12 in) above the normal sea surface they grow in height when they reach shallower water in a wave shoaling process described below a tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas
on april 1 1946 a magnitude-7.8 (richter scale) earthquake occurred near the aleutian islands alaska it generated a tsunami which inundated hilo on the island of hawai'i with a 14-metre high (46 ft) surge the area where the earthquake occurred is where the pacific ocean floor is subducting (or being pushed downwards) under alaska
examples of tsunami originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include storegga about 8,000 years ago grand banks 1929 papua new guinea 1998 (tappin 2001) the grand banks and papua new guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami they dissipated before traveling transoceanic distances
the cause of the storegga sediment failure is unknown possibilities include an overloading of the sediments an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.)
the 1960 valdivia earthquake (mw 9.5) 1964 alaska earthquake (mw 9.2) 2004 indian ocean earthquake (mw 9.2) and 2011 thoku earthquake (mw9.0) are recent examples of powerful megathrust earthquakes that generated tsunamis (known as teletsunamis) that can cross entire oceans smaller (mw 4.2) earthquakes in japan can trigger tsunamis (called local and regional tsunamis) that can only devastate nearby coasts but can do so in only a few minutes
=== landslidesedit ===
in the 1950s it was discovered that larger tsunamis than had previously been believed possible could be caused by giant submarine landslides these rapidly displace large water volumes as energy transfers to the water at a rate faster than the water can absorb their existence was confirmed in 1958 when a giant landslide in lituya bay alaska caused the highest wave ever recorded which had a height of 524 metres (over 1700 feet) the wave did not travel far as it struck land almost immediately two people fishing in the bay were killed but another boat amazingly managed to ride the wave
another landslide-tsunami event occurred in 1963 when a massive landslide from monte toc entered the vajont dam in italy the resulting wave surged over the 262 m (860 ft) high dam by 250 metres (820 ft) and destroyed several towns around 2,000 people died scientists named these waves megatsunamis
some geologists claim that large landslides from volcanic islands e.g cumbre vieja on la palma in the canary islands may be able to generate megatsunamis that can cross oceans but this is disputed by many others
in general landslides generate displacements mainly in the shallower parts of the coastline and there is conjecture about the nature of large landslides that enter water this has been shown to lead to effect water in enclosed bays and lakes but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history susceptible locations are believed to be the big island of hawaii fogo in the cape verde islands la reunion in the indian ocean and cumbre vieja on the island of la palma in the canary islands along with other volcanic ocean islands this is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing however there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are
=== meteotsunamisedit ===
some meteorological conditions especially deep depressions such as tropical cyclones can generate a type of storm surge called a meteotsunami which raises water heights above normal levels often suddenly at the shoreline
in the case of deep tropical cyclones this is due to very low atmospheric pressure and inward swirling winds causing an uplifted dome of water to form under and travel in tandem with the storm when these water domes reach shore they surge upward in shallows and laterally much as do earthquake-generated tsunamis typically arriving shortly after landfall of the storm's eye
=== man-made or triggered tsunamisedit ===
there have been studies of the potential of induction of and at least one actual attempt to create tsunami waves as a tectonic weapon
in world war ii the new zealand military forces initiated project seal which attempted to create small tsunamis with explosives in the area of today's shakespear regional park the attempt failed
there has been considerable speculation on the possibility of using nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis near to an enemy coastline even during world war ii consideration of the idea using conventional explosives was explored nuclear testing in the pacific proving ground by the united states seemed to generate poor results operation crossroads fired two 20 kilotonnes of tnt (84 tj) bombs one in the air and one underwater above and below the shallow (50 m (160 ft)) waters of the bikini atoll lagoon fired about 6 km (3.7 mi) from the nearest island the waves there were no higher than 34 m (9.813.1 ft) upon reaching the shoreline other underwater tests mainly hardtack i/wahoo (deep water) and hardtack i/umbrella (shallow water) confirmed the results analysis of the effects of shallow and deep underwater explosions indicate that the energy of the explosions doesn't easily generate the kind of deep all-ocean waveforms which are tsunamis most of the energy creates steam causes vertical fountains above the water and creates compressional waveforms tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which don't occur in explosions
== characteristicsedit ==
tsunamis cause damage by two mechanisms the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it even with waves that do not appear to be large
while everyday wind waves have a wavelength (from crest to crest) of about 100 metres (330 ft) and a height of roughly 2 metres (6.6 ft) a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to 200 kilometres (120 mi) such a wave travels at well over 800 kilometres per hour (500 mph) but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about 1 metre (3.3 ft) this makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water where ships are unable to feel their passage
the velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in meters multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10 m sec2) for example if the pacific ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 meters the velocity of a tsunami would be the square root of 5000 x 10 = 50000 = ~224 meters per second (735 feet per second) which equates to a speed of ~806 kilometers per hour or about 500 miles per hour this formula is the same as used for calculating the velocity of shallow waves because a tsunami behaves like a shallow wave as it peak to peak value reaches from the floor of the ocean to the surface
the reason for the japanese name harbour wave is that sometimes a village's fishermen would sail out and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave
as the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph) its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometres (12 mi) and its amplitude grows enormously since the wave still has the same very long period the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height except for the very largest tsunamis the approaching wave does not break but rather appears like a fast-moving tidal bore open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step-like wave with a steep-breaking front
when the tsunami's wave peak reaches the shore the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed run up run up is measured in metres above a reference sea level a large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving over a period of hours with significant time between the wave crests the first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest run up
about 80% of tsunamis occur in the pacific ocean but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water including lakes they are caused by earthquakes landslides volcanic explosions glacier calvings and bolides
== drawbackedit ==
all waves have a positive and negative peak i.e a ridge and a trough in the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami either may be the first to arrive if the first part to arrive at shore is the ridge a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land however if the first part to arrive is a trough a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically exposing normally submerged areas drawback can exceed hundreds of metres and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed
a typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about 12 minutes this means that if the drawback phase is the first part of the wave to arrive the sea will recede with areas well below sea level exposed after 3 minutes during the next 6 minutes the tsunami wave trough builds into a ridge and during this time the sea is filled in and destruction occurs on land during the next 6 minutes the tsunami wave changes from a ridge to a trough causing flood waters to drain and drawback to occur again this may sweep victims and debris some distance from land the process repeats as the next wave arrives
== scales of intensity and magnitudeedit ==
as with earthquakes several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events
=== intensity scalesedit ===
the first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunami were the sieberg-ambraseys scale used in the mediterranean sea and the imamura-iida intensity scale used in the pacific ocean the latter scale was modified by soloviev who calculated the tsunami intensity i according to the formula
where is the average wave height along the nearest coast this scale known as the soloviev-imamura tsunami intensity scale is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the ngdc/noaa and the novosibirsk tsunami laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami
in 2013 following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011 a new 12 point scale was proposed the integrated tsunami intensity scale (itis-2012) intended to match as closely as possible to the modified esi2007 and ems earthquake intensity scales
=== magnitude scalesedit ===
the first scale that genuinely calculated a magnitude for a tsunami rather than an intensity at a particular location was the ml scale proposed by murty & loomis based on the potential energy difficulties in calculating the potential energy of the tsunami mean that this scale is rarely used abe introduced the tsunami magnitude scale  calculated from
where h is the maximum tsunami-wave amplitude (in m) measured by a tide gauge at a distance r from the epicentre a b and d are constants used to make the mt scale match as closely as possible with the moment magnitude scale
== warnings and predictionsedit ==
drawbacks can serve as a brief warning people who observe drawback (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound) can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings in 2004 ten-year-old tilly smith of surrey england was on maikhao beach in phuket thailand with her parents and sister and having learned about tsunamis recently in school told her family that a tsunami might be imminent her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived saving dozens of lives she credited her geography teacher andrew kearney
in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami drawback was not reported on the african coast or any other east-facing coasts that it reached this was because the wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the fault line and upwards on the western side the western pulse hit coastal africa and other western areas
a tsunami cannot be precisely predicted even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known geologists oceanographers and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning however there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives one of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors attached to buoys which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column
regions with a high tsunami risk typically use tsunami warning systems to warn the population before the wave reaches land on the west coast of the united states which is prone to pacific ocean tsunami warning signs indicate evacuation routes in japan the community is well-educated about earthquakes and tsunamis and along the japanese shorelines the tsunami warning signs are reminders of the natural hazards together with a network of warning sirens typically at the top of the cliff of surroundings hills
the pacific tsunami warning system is based in honolulu hawaii it monitors pacific ocean seismic activity a sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning while the subduction zones around the pacific are seismically active not all earthquakes generate tsunami computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the pacific ocean and the adjoining land masses
as a direct result of the indian ocean tsunami a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat for all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the united nations disaster mitigation committee a tsunami warning system is being installed in the indian ocean
computer models can predict tsunami arrival usually within minutes of the arrival time bottom pressure sensors can relay information in real time based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor's shape (bathymetry) and coastal topography the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami all pacific rim countries collaborate in the tsunami warning system and most regularly practice evacuation and other procedures in japan such preparation is mandatory for government local authorities emergency services and the population
some zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic rayleigh waves from an earthquake or a tsunami if correct monitoring their behavior could provide advance warning of earthquakes tsunami etc however the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted there are unsubstantiated claims about the lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground while many other animals in the same areas drowned the phenomenon was also noted by media sources in sri lanka in the 2004 indian ocean earthquake it is possible that certain animals (e.g. elephants) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast the elephants reaction was to move away from the approaching noise by contrast some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result
along the united states west coast in addition to sirens warnings are sent on television and radio via the national weather service using the emergency alert system
=== forecast of tsunami attack probabilityedit ===
kunihiko shimazaki (university of tokyo) a member of earthquake research committee of the headquarters for earthquake research promotion of japanese government mentioned the plan to public announcement of tsunami attack probability forecast at japan national press club on 12 may 2011 the forecast includes tsunami height attack area and occurrence probability within 100 years ahead the forecast would integrate the scientific knowledge of recent interdisciplinarity and aftermath of the 2011 thoku earthquake and tsunami as the plan announcement will be available from 2014
== mitigationedit ==
in some tsunami-prone countries earthquake engineering measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore
japan where tsunami science and response measures first began following a disaster in 1896 has produced ever-more elaborate countermeasures and response plans that country has built many tsunami walls of up to 12 metres (39 ft) high to protect populated coastal areas other localities have built floodgates of up to 15.5 metres (51 ft) high and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunami however their effectiveness has been questioned as tsunami often overtop the barriers
the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster was directly triggered by the 2011 thoku earthquake and tsunami when waves exceeded the height of the plant's sea wall iwate prefecture which is an area at high risk from tsunami had tsunami barriers walls totalling 25 kilometres (16 mi) long at coastal towns the 2011 tsunami toppled more than 50% of the walls and caused catastrophic damage
the okushiri hokkaid tsunami which struck okushiri island of hokkaid within two to five minutes of the earthquake on july 12 1993 created waves as much as 30 metres (100 ft) tallas high as a 10-story building the port town of aonae was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area the wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life
