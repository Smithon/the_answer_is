ecuador (/kwdr/ e-kw-dawr spanish [ekwaor]) officially the republic of ecuador (spanish repblica del ecuador which literally translates as republic of the equator") is a representative democratic republic in northwestern south america bordered by colombia on the north peru on the east and south and the pacific ocean to the west ecuador also includes the galpagos islands in the pacific about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) west of the mainland
what is now ecuador was home to a variety of amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the inca empire during the fifteenth century the territory was colonized by spain during the sixteenth century achieving independence in 1820 as part of gran colombia from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 the legacy of both empires is reflected in ecuador's ethnically diverse population with most of its 15.2 million people being mestizos followed by large minorities of european amerindian and african descendants
spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population though thirteen amerindian languages are also recognized including quichua and shuar the capital city is quito while the largest city is guayaquil in reflection of the country's rich cultural heritage the historical center of quito was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1978 cuenca the third-largest city was also declared a world heritage site in 1999 as an outstanding example of a planned inland spanish-style colonial city in the americas
ecuador has a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities namely petroleum and agricultural products the country is classified as a medium-income country ecuador is a democratic presidential republic the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable rights of nature or ecosystem rights ecuador is also known for its rich ecology hosting many endemic plants and animals such as those of the galpagos islands it is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world
== history ==
=== pre-inca era ===
before the arrival of the incas the area was settled by various peoples some likely sailed to ecuador by rafts from central america others came to ecuador via the amazon tributaries others descended from northern south america and others ascended from the southern part of south america through the andes or by sailing on rafts they developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups
even though their languages were unrelated these groups developed similar cultures because they lived in the same environment the people of the coast developed a fishing hunting and gathering culture the people of the highland andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life and the people of the amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting and gathering way of life
over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe with a similar language and culture many civilizations arose in ecuador such as the valdivia culture and machalilla culture on the coast the quitus (near present-day quito) and the caari (near present-day cuenca) each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture pottery and religious interests
in the highland andes mountains where life was more sedentary groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals were formed eventually through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders a group of nations formed confederations one region was consolidated under a confederation called the shyris which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions its political and military power was under the rule of the duchicela blood line
=== inca era ===
when the incas arrived they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the incas two generations of rulers - topa inca yupanqui and huayna capac - to absorb these confederations into the inca empire the native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to far away areas of peru bolivia and north argentina similarly a number of loyal inca subjects from peru and bolivia were brought to ecuador to prevent rebellion thus the region of highland ecuador became part of the inca empire in 1463 sharing the same language
in contrast when the incas made incursions into coastal ecuador and the eastern amazon jungles of ecuador they found both the environment and natives more hostile moreover when the incas tried to subdue them these natives withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics as a result inca expansion into the amazon basin and the pacific coast of ecuador was hampered the natives of the amazon jungle and coastal ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force the amazonian natives and the cayapas of coastal ecuador were the only groups to resist inca and spanish domination maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century
before the arrival of the spaniards the inca empire was involved in a civil war the untimely death of both the heir ninan cuchi and the emperor huayna capac from a european disease that spread into ecuador created a power vacuum between two factions the northern faction headed by atahualpa claims that huayna capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided he gave the territories pertaining to present-day ecuador and northern peru to his favorite son atahualpa who was to rule from quito and he gave the rest to huscar who was to rule from cuzco he willed that his heart be buried in quito his favorite city and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in cuzco
huscar did not recognize his father's will since it did not follow inca traditions of naming an inca through the priests huscar ordered atahualpa to attend their father's burial in cuzco and pay homage to him as the new inca ruler atahualpa with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers decided to ignore huscar and a civil war ensued a number of bloody battles took place until finally huscar was captured atahualpa marched south to cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother
a small band of spaniards headed by francisco pizarro landed in tumbez and marched over the andes mountains until they reached cajamarca where the new inca atahualpa was to hold an interview with them valverde the priest tried to convince atahualpa that he should join the catholic church and declare himself a vassal of spain this infuriated atahualpa so much that he threw the bible to the ground at this point the enraged spaniards with orders from valverde attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the inca and captured atahualpa pizarro promised to release atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold but after a mock trial the spaniards executed atahualpa by strangulation
=== spanish rule ===
new infectious diseases endemic to the europeans caused high fatalities among the amerindian population during the first decades of spanish rule as they had no immunity at the same time the natives were forced into the encomienda labor system for the spanish in 1563 quito became the seat of a real audiencia (administrative district) of spain and part of the viceroyalty of peru and later the viceroyalty of new granada
after nearly 300 years of spanish rule quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants on august 10 1809 the city's criollos first called for independence from spain (among the peoples of latin america) they were led by juan po montfar quiroga salinas and bishop cuero y caicedo quito's nickname luz de amrica ("light of america") is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent and local government although the new government lasted no more than two months it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of spanish america
=== independence ===
on october 9 1820 guayaquil became the first city in ecuador to gain its independence from spain the people were very happy about the independence and celebrated which is now ecuador's independence day officially on may 24 1822 the rest of ecuador gained its independence after antonio jos de sucre defeated the spanish royalist forces at the battle of pichincha near quito following the battle ecuador joined simn bolvar's republic of gran colombia joining with modern-day colombia and venezuela in 1830 it separated from those nations and became an independent republic
the 19th century for ecuador was marked by instability with a rapid succession of rulers the first president of ecuador was the venezuelan-born juan jos flores who was ultimately deposed followed by several authoritarian leaders such as vicente rocafuerte jos joaqun de olmedo jos mara urbina diego noboa pedro jos de arteta manuel de ascsubi and flores's own son antonio flores jijn among others the conservative gabriel garcia moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the roman catholic church in the late 19th century world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast
ecuador abolished slavery and freed its black slaves in 1851
=== liberal revolution ===
the liberal revolution of 1895 under eloy alfaro reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners this liberal wing retained power until the military julian revolution of 1925 the 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians such as five-time president jos mara velasco ibarra
=== loss of claimed territories since 1830 ===
==== president juan jos flores de jure territorial claims for ecuador ====
since ecuador's separation from colombia in may 13 1830 its first president general juan jos flores laid claim to the territory that was called the real audiencia of quito also referred to as the presidencia of quito he supported his claims with spanish royal decrees or real cedulas that delineated the borders of spain's former overseas colonies in the case of ecuador flores-based ecuador's de jure claims on the following cedulas - real cedula of 1563 1739 and 1740 with modifications in the amazon basin and andes mountains that were introduced through the treaty of guayaquil (1829) which peru reluctantly signed after the overwhelmingly outnumbered gran colombian force led by antonio jos de sucre defeated president and general la mar's peruvian invasion force in the battle of tarqui in addition ecuador's eastern border with the portuguese colony of brazil in the amazon basin was modified before the wars of independence by the first treaty of san ildefonso (1777) between the spanish empire and the portuguese empire moreover to add legitimacy to his claims on february 16 1840 flores signed a treaty with spain whereby flores convinced spain to officially recognize ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over spain's former colonial territory known anciently to spain as the kingdom and presidency of quito
ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors such as colombia in 1832 and 1916 brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties and peru after a short war in which the protocol of rio de janeiro was signed in 1942
==== struggle for independence ====
during the struggle for independence before peru or ecuador became independent nations a few areas of the former vice royalty of new granada - guayaquil tumbez and jan - declared themselves independent from spain a few months later a part of the peruvian liberation army of san martin decided to occupy the independent cities of tumbez and jan with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the audiencia de quito (ecuador) it was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader san martin wished to liberate present-day ecuador and add it to the future republic of peru since it had been part of the inca empire before the spaniards conquered it but bolvar's intention was to form a new republic known as the gran colombia out of the liberated spanish territory of new granada which consisted of colombia venezuela and ecuador san martin's plans were thwarted when bolvar with the help of marshal antonio jos de sucre and the gran colombian liberation force descended from the andes mountains and occupied guayaquil they also annexed the newly liberated audiencia de quito to the republic of gran colombia this happened a few days before san martin's peruvian forces could arrive and occupy guayaquil with the intention of annexing guayaquil to the rest of audiencia of quito (ecuador) and to the future republic of peru historic documents repeatedly stated that san martin told bolivar he came to guayaquil to liberate the land of the incas from spain bolivar countered by sending a message from guayaquil welcoming san martin and his troops to colombian soil
==== peruvian occupation of jan tumbez and guayaquil ====
in the south ecuador had de jure claims to a small piece of land beside the pacific ocean known as tumbez which lay between the zarumilla and tumbez rivers in ecuador's southern andes mountain region where the maraon cuts across ecuador had de jure claims to an area it called jan de bracamoros these areas were included as part of the territory of gran colombia by bolivar in december 17 1819 during the congress of angostura when the republic of gran colombia was created tumbez declared itself independent from spain on january 17 1821 and jaen de bracamoros on june 17 1821 without any outside help from revolutionary armies however that same year 1821 peruvian forces participating in the trujillo revolution occupied both jaen and tumbez some peruvian generals without any legal titles backing them up and with ecuador still federated with the gran colombia had the desire to annex ecuador to the republic of peru at the expense of the gran colombia feeling that ecuador was once part of the inca empire then on july 28 1821 peruvian independence was proclaimed in lima by the liberator san martin and tumbez and jaen which were included as part of the revolution of trujillo by the peruvian occupying force had the whole region swear allegiance to the new peruvian flag and incorporated itself into peru even though peru was not completely liberated from spain after peru was completely liberated from spain by the patriot armies led by bolivar and antonio jose sucre at the battle of ayacucho dated december 9 1824 there was a strong desire by some peruvians to resurrect the inca empire and to include bolivia and ecuador one of these peruvian generals was the ecuadorian-born jos de la mar who became one of peru's presidents after bolivar resigned as dictator of peru and returned to colombia gran colombia had always protested peru for the return of jaen and tumbez for almost a decade then finally bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of jaen tumbez and part of mainas declared war president and general jos de la mar who was born in ecuador believing his opportunity had come to annex the district of ecuador to peru personally with a peruvian force invaded and occupied guayaquil and a few cities in the loja region of southern ecuador on november 28 1828 the war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern gran colombian army at battle of tarqui dated february 27 1829 led by antonio jos de sucre defeated the peruvian invasion force led by president la mar this defeat led to the signing of the treaty of guayaquil dated september 22 1829 whereby peru and its congress recognized gran colombian rights over tumbez jaen and maynas through protocolized meetings between representatives of peru and gran colombia the border was set as tumbez river in the west and in the east the maranon and amazon rivers were to be followed toward brazil as the most natural borders between them however what was pending was whether the new border around the jaen region should follow the chinchipe river or the huancabamba river according to the peace negotiations peru agreed to return guayaquil tumbez and jan despite this peru returned guayaquil but failed to return tumbez and jan alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements since the gran colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - ecuador colombia and venezuela
==== the dissolution of gran colombia ====
the central district of the gran colombia known as cundinamarca or new granada (modern colombia) with its capital in bogota did not recognize the separation of the southern district of the gran colombia with its capital in quito from the gran colombian federation on may 13 1830 after ecuador's separation the department of cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with ecuador due to instability in the central government of bogota president juan jos flores with the approval of the ecuadorian congress annexed the department of cauca on december 20 1830 since the government of cauca had called for union with the district of the south as far back as april 1830 moreover the cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of ecuador also the cauca region which included such cities as pasto popayan and buenaventura had always been dependent on the presidencia or audiencia of quito fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of bogota and quito where the government of bogota didn't recognize the separation of ecuador or that of cauca from the gran colombia until war broke out in may 1832 in five months new granada defeated ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the ecuadorian armed forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from venezuela and colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen seeing that his officers were rebelling mutinying and changing sides president flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with new granada the treaty of pasto of 1832 was signed by which the department of cauca was turned over to new granada (modern colombia) the government of bogota recognized ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the ley de divisin territorial de la repblica de colombia (law of the division of territory of the gran colombia) passed on june 25 1824 this law set the border at the river carchi and the eastern border that stretched to brazil at the caquet river later ecuador contended that the republic of colombia while reorganizing its government unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that colombia extended its claims south to the napo river because it said that the government of popayan extended its control all the way to the napo river
==== struggle for possession of the amazon basin known as maynas ====
when ecuador seceded from the gran colombia peru decided not to follow the treaty of guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made peru contested ecuador's claims with the newly discovered real cedula of 1802 by which peru claims the king of spain had transferred these lands from the viceroyalty of new granada to the viceroyalty of peru during colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding portuguese settlements into spanish domains which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of jesuit missionaries from their bases along the amazon basin ecuador countered by labeling the cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument which had nothing to do with political borders peru began its de facto occupation of disputed amazonian territories after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of brazil this treaty disregarded spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a spanish-portuguese treaty over the amazon regarding territories held by illegal portuguese settlers peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the mainas or maynas region which it began calling loreto with its capital in iquitos during its negotiations with brazil peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802 it claimed amazonian basin territories up to caqueta river in the north and toward the andes mountain range depriving ecuador and colombia of all their claims to the amazon basin colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the napo and amazon rivers ecuador protested that it claimed the amazon basin between the caqueta river and the maraon-amazon river peru ignored these protests and created the department of loreto in 1853 with its capital in iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both colombia and ecuador peru briefly occupied guayaquil again in 1860 since peru thought that ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to british bond holders but returned guayaquil after a few months the border dispute was then submitted to spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910 but to no avail
in the early part of the 20th century ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern amazonian borders with its neighbors through negotiation on may 6 1904 ecuador signed the tobar - rio branco treaty recognizing brazils claims to the amazon in recognition of ecuador's claim to be an amazonian country to counter peru's earlier treaty with brazil back in october 23 1851 then after a few meetings with the colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the muoz vernaza-suarez treaty was signed july 15 1916 in which colombian rights to the putumayo river were recognized as well as ecuador's rights to the napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those to rivers in this way ecuador gave up the claims it had to the amazonian territories between the caquet river and napo river to colombia thus cutting itself off from brazil later a brief war erupted between colombia and peru over peru's claims to the caquet region which ended with the peru reluctantly signing the salomon-lozano treaty on march 24 1922 ecuador protested this secret treaty since colombia gave away ecuadorian claimed land to peru that ecuador had given to colombia in 1916
in july 21 1924 the ponce-castro oyanguren protocol was signed between ecuador and peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the united states for arbitration negotiations between the ecuadorian and peruvian representatives began in washington on september 30 1935 these negotiations were long and tiresome both sides logically presented their cases but no one seemed to give up their claims then on february 6 1937 ecuador presented a transactional line which peru rejected the next day the negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on september 29 1937 the peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere
four years later in 1941 amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the zarumilla river war broke out with peru peru claimed that ecuador's military presence in peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion ecuador for its part claimed that peru had recently invaded ecuador around the zarumilla river and that peru since ecuador's independence from spain has systematically occupied tumbez jaen and most of the disputed territories in the amazonian basin between the putomayo and maraon rivers in july 1941 troops were mobilized in both countries peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed ecuadorian force of 2,300 of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces hostilities erupted on july 5 1941 when peruvian forces crossed the zarumilla river at several locations testing the strength and resolve of the ecuadorian border troops finally on july 23 1941 the peruvians launched a major invasion crossing the zarumilla river in force and advancing into the ecuadorian province of el oro
during the course of the ecuadorianperuvian war peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of el oro and some parts of the province of loja demanding that the ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims the peruvian navy blocked the port of guayaquil almost cutting all supplies to the ecuadorian troops after a few weeks of war and under pressure by the united states and several latin american nations all fighting came to a stop ecuador and peru came to an accord formalized in the rio protocol signed on january 29 1942 in favor of hemispheric unity against the axis powers in world war ii favoring peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end
the 1944 glorious may revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed carlos arroyo del ro as a dictator from ecuador's government however a post-second world war recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s while foreign companies developed oil resources in the ecuadorian amazon in 1972 construction of the andean pipeline was completed the pipeline brought oil from the east side of the andes to the coast making ecuador south america's second largest oil exporter the pipeline in southern ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between ecuador and peru however
the rio protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote cordillera del cndor region in southern ecuador this caused a long-simmering dispute between ecuador and peru which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries first a border skirmish in januaryfebruary 1981 known as the paquisha incident and ultimately full-scale warfare in january 1995 where the ecuadorian military shot down peruvian aircraft and helicopters and peruvian infantry marched into southern ecuador each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities known as the cenepa war sixto durn balln the ecuadorian president famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of ecuador popular sentiment in ecuador became strongly nationalistic against peru graffiti could be seen on the walls of quito referring to peru as the cain de latinoamrica a reference to the murder of abel by his brother cain in the book of genesis
ecuador and peru signed the brasilia presidential act peace agreement on october 26 1998 which ended hostilities and effectively put an end to the western hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute the guarantors of the rio protocol (argentina brazil chile and the united states of america) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the cordillera del cndor while ecuador had to give up its decades-old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the cordillera as well as to the entire western area of cenepa headwaters peru was compelled to give to ecuador in perpetual lease but without sovereignty 1 km2 of its territory in the area where the ecuadorian base of tiwinza focal point of the war had been located within peruvian soil and which the ecuadorian army held during the conflict the final border demarcation came into effect on may 13 1999 and the multi-national momep (military observer mission for ecuador and peru) troop deployment withdrew on june 17 1999
=== military governments (197279) ===
in 1972 a revolutionary and nationalist military junta overthrew the government of velasco ibarra the coup d'tat was led by general guillermo rodrguez and executed by navy commander jorge queirolo g the new president exiled jos mara velasco to argentina he remained in power until 1976 when he was removed by another military government that military junta was led by admiral alfredo poveda who was declared chairman of the supreme council the supreme council included two other members:general guillermo durn arcentales and general luis leoro franco the civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections colonel richelieu levoyer government minister proposed and implemented a plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections this plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office
=== return to democracy ===
elections were held on april 29 1979 under a new constitution jaime rolds aguilera was elected president garnering over one million votes the most in ecuadorian history he took office on august 10 as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships in 1980 he founded the partido pueblo cambio y democracia (people change and democracy party) after withdrawing from the concentracin de fuerzas populares (popular forces concentration) and governed until may 24 1981 when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense marco subia martinez when his air force plane crashed in heavy rain near the peruvian border many people believe that he was assassinated by the cia given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident
roldos was immediately succeeded by vice president osvaldo hurtado who was followed in 1984 by len febres cordero from the social christian party rodrigo borja cevallos of the democratic left (izquierda democrtica or id) party won the presidency in 1988 running in the runoff election against abdal bucaram (brother in law of jaime roldos and founder of the ecuadorian roldosist party) his government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms notably an opening of ecuador to foreign trade the borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group alfaro vive carajo! ("alfaro lives dammit!") named after eloy alfaro however continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the id and opposition parties gained control of congress in 1999
the emergence of the amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years the population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform lower unemployment and provision of social services and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite their movement along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements has led to a deterioration of the executive office the populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital as illustrated by the most recent removal of president lucio gutirrez from office by congress in april 2005 vice president alfredo palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential election of 2006 in which rafael correa gained the presidency
in december 2008 president correa declared ecuador's national debt illegitimate based on the argument that it was odious debt contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes he announced that the country would default on over $3 billion worth of bonds he then pledged to fight creditors in international courts and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60% he brought ecuador into the bolivarian alliance for the americas in june 2009 to date correa's administration has succeeded in reducing the high levels of poverty and unemployment in ecuador

the ecuadorian armed forces (fuerzas armadas del ecuador) consists of the army air force and navy and have the stated responsibility for the preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory
the military tradition starts in gran colombia where a sizable army was stationed in ecuador due to border disputes with peru which claimed territories under its political control when it was a spanish vice-royalty once gran colombia was dissolved after the death of simn bolvar in 1830 ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force so influential was the military in ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of general juan jose flores first president of ecuador of venezuelan origin general jose ma urbina and general robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period
due to the continuous border disputes with peru finally settled in the early 2000s and due to the ongoing problem with the colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating amazonian provinces the ecuadorian armed forces has gone through a series of changes in 2009 the new administration at the defense ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803 an increase of 25%
the icons of the ecuadorian military forces are the marshall antonio jos de sucre and general eloy alfaro the military academy general eloy alfaro (c 1838) graduates the army officers and is located in quito the ecuadorian navy academy (c 1837) located in salinas graduates the navy officers and the air academy cosme rennella (c 1920) also located in salinas graduates the air force officers other training academies for different military specialties are found across the country
== geography ==
ecuador has a total area of 283,520 km2 (109,468 sq mi) including the galpagos islands of this 283,520 km2 (109,468 sq mi) is land and 6,720 km2 (2,595 sq mi) water ecuador is bigger than uruguay surinam guyana and french guyana in south america
ecuador lies between latitudes 2n and 5s bounded on the west by the pacific ocean and has 2,337 km (1,452 mi) of coastline it has 2,010 km (1,250 mi) of land boundaries with colombia in the north (590 km or 370 mi border) and peru in the east and south (1,420 km or 882 mi border)
the country has four main geographic regions
la costa or the coast the coastal region consists of the provinces to the west of the andean range - esmeraldas guayas los ros manab el oro santa elena it is the country's most fertile and productive land and is the seat of the large banana exportation plantations of the companies dole and chiquita this region is also where most of ecuador's rice crop is grown the truly coastal provinces have active fisheries the largest coastal city is guayaquil
la sierra or the highlands the sierra consists of the andean and interandean highland provinces - azuay caar carchi chimborazo imbabura loja pichincha and tungurahua this land contains most of ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of potato maize and quinua and the population is predominantly amerindian kichua the largest sierran city is quito
la amazona also known as el oriente or the east the oriente consists of the amazon jungle provinces - morona santiago napo orellana pastaza sucumbos and zamora-chinchipe this region is primarily made up of the huge amazon national parks and amerindian untouchable zones which are vasts stretches of land set aside for the amazon amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally it is also the area with the largest reserves of petroleum in ecuador and parts of the upper amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies the population is primarily mixed amerindian shuar huaorani and kichua although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted the largest city in the oriente is probably lago agrio in sucumbos although macas in morona santiago runs a close second
la regin insular is the region comprising the galpagos islands some 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) west of the mainland in the pacific ocean
ecuador's capital is quito which is in the province of pichincha in the sierra region its largest city is guayaquil in the guayas province cotopaxi which is just south of quito features one of the world's highest active volcanoes the top of mount chimborazo (6,268 m or 20,560 ft above sea level) is considered to be the most distant point of the earth's surface from the center of the earth given the approximately ellipsoid shape of the planet
=== climate ===
there is great variety in the climate largely determined by altitude it is mild year-round in the mountain valleys with a humid subtropical climate in coastal areas and rainforest in lowlands the pacific coastal area has a tropical climate with a severe rainy season the climate in the andean highlands is temperate and relatively dry and the amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones
because of its location at the equator ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours
=== hydrology ===
the andes is the watershed divisor between the amazon watershed which runs to the east and the pacific including the northsouth rivers mataje santiago esmeraldas chone guayas jubones and puyango-tumbes
almost all of the rivers in ecuador form in the la sierra region and flow east toward the amazon river or west toward the pacific ocean the rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations in the la sierra region the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the andes to the lower elevations of the other regions the highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the costa and the oriente
in the costa the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from december through may and become empty riverbeds during the dry season the few exceptions are the longer perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and la sierra on their way to the pacific ocean the internal coast by contrast is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season sometimes forming swamps
major rivers in the oriente include the pastaza napo and putumayo the pastaza is formed by the confluence of the chambo and the patate rivers both of which rise in the sierra the pastaza includes the agoyan waterfall which at sixty-one meters (200 feet) is the highest waterfall in ecuador the napo rises near mount cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands the napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 m (1,600 to 5,900 ft) in its upper reaches the napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries the coca river where it slows and levels off the putumayo forms part of the border with colombia all of these rivers flow into the amazon river the galpagos islands have no significant rivers several of the larger islands however have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the pacific ocean
=== biodiversity ===
ecuador is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world according to conservation international and it has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation
ecuador has 1,600 bird species (15% of the world's known bird species) in the continental area and 38 more endemic in the galpagos in addition to over 16,000 species of plants the country has 106 endemic reptiles 138 endemic amphibians and 6,000 species of butterfly the galpagos islands are well known as a region of distinct fauna famous as the place of birth of darwin's theory of evolution and a unesco world heritage site
ecuador has the first constitution to recognize the rights of nature the protection of the nation's biodiversity is an explicit national priority as stated in the national plan of buen vivir or good living objective 4 guarantee the rights of nature policy 1 sustainably conserve and manage the natural heritage including its land and marine biodiversity which is considered a strategic sector as of the writing of the plan in 2008 19% of ecuador's land area was in a protected area however the plan also states that 32% of the land must be protected in order to truly preserve the nation's biodiversity current protected areas include 11 national parks 10 wildlife refuges 9 ecological reserves and other areas a program begun in 2008 sociobosque is preserving another 2.3% of total land area (6,295 km or 629,500 ha) by paying private landowners or community landowners (such as amerindian tribes) incentives to maintain their land as native ecosystems such as native forests or grasslands eligibility and subsidy rates for this program are determined based on the poverty in the region the number of hectares that will be protected and the type of ecosystem of the land to be protected among other factors
despite being on the unesco list the galpagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental effects threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem additionally oil exploitation of the amazon rainforest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes gas and crude oil into the environment contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to amerindian peoples
== economy ==
ecuador has a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities namely petroleum and agricultural products the country is classified as a medium-income country ecuador's economy is the eighth largest in latin america and experienced an average growth of 4.6% between 2000 and 2006 from 2007 to 2012 ecuador's gdp grew at an annual average of 4.3 percent above the average for latin america and the caribbean which was 3.5% according to the united nations economic commission for latin american and the caribbean (eclac) ecuador was able to maintain relatively superior growth during the crisis in january 2009 the central bank of ecuador (bce) put the 2010 growth forecast at 6.88% in 2011 its gdp grew at 8% and ranked 3rd highest in latin america behind argentina (2nd) and panama (1st) between 1999 and 2007 gdp doubled reaching $65,490 million according to bce inflation rate up to january 2008 was located about 1.14% the highest recorded in the last year according to the government the monthly unemployment rate remained at about 6 and 8 percent from december 2007 until september 2008 however it went up to about 9 percent in october and dropped again in november 2008 to 8 percent unemployment mean annual rate for 2009 in ecuador was 8.5% because the global economic crisis continued to affect the latin american economies from this point unemployment rates started a downward trend 7.6% in 2010 6.0% in 2011 and 4.8% in 2012
the extreme poverty rate has declined significantly between 1999 and 2010 in 2001 it was estimated at 40% of the population while by 2011 the figure dropped to 17.4% of the total population this is explained to an extent by emigration and the economic stability achieved after adopting the u.s dollar as official means of transaction however starting in 2008 with the bad economic performance of the nations where most ecuadorian emigrants work the reduction of poverty has been realized through social spending mainly in education and health
oil accounts for 40% of exports and contributes to maintaining a positive trade balance since the late 1960s the exploitation of oil increased production and proven reserves are estimated at 6.51 billion barrels as of 2011
the overall trade balance for august 2012 was a surplus of almost $390 million for the first six months of 2012 a huge figure compared with that of 2007 which reached only $5.7 million the surplus had risen by about $425 million compared to 2006 the oil trade balance positive had revenues of $3.295 million in 2008 while non-oil was negative amounting to $2.842 million the trade balance with the united states chile the european union bolivia peru brazil and mexico is positive the trade balance with argentina colombia and asia is negative
in the agricultural sector ecuador is a major exporter of bananas (first place worldwide in production and export) flowers and the seventh largest producer of cocoa the shrimp sugar cane rice cotton corn palm and coffee productions are also significant the country's vast resources include large amounts of timber across the country like eucalyptus and mangroves pines and cedars are planted in the region of la sierra and walnuts rosemary and balsa wood in the guayas river basin the industry is concentrated mainly in guayaquil the largest industrial center and in quito where in recent years the industry has grown considerably this city is also the largest business center of the country industrial production is directed primarily to the domestic market despite this there is limited export of products produced or processed industrially these include canned foods liquor jewelry furniture and more a minor industrial activity is also concentrated in cuenca the incomes due to the tourism have been increasing during the last years because of the efforts of the government of showing the variety of climates and the biodiversity in ecuador http://www.ecuador.travel/
ecuador has negotiated bilateral treaties with other countries besides belonging to the andean community of nations and an associate member of mercosur it also serves on the world trade organization (wto) in addition to the inter-american development bank (idb) world bank international monetary fund (imf) corporacin andina de fomento (caf) and other multilateral agencies in april 2007 ecuador paid off its debt to the imf thus ending an era of interventionism of the agency in the country the public finance of ecuador consists of the central bank of ecuador (bce) the national development bank (bnf) the state bank the national finance corporation the ecuadorian housing bank (bev) and the ecuadorian educational loans and grants
between 2006 and 2009 the government increased social spending on social welfare and education from 2.6% to 5.2% of its gdp starting in 2007 with an economy surpassed by the economic crisis ecuador was subject to a number of economic policy reforms by the government that have helped steer the ecuadorian economy to a sustained substantial and focused financial stability and social policy such policies were expansionary fiscal policies of access to housing finance stimulus packs and limiting the amount of money reserves banks could keep abroad the ecuadorian government has made huge investments in education and infrastructure throughout the nation which have improved the lives of the poor
in 2000 ecuador changed its currency from the sucre to the u.s dollar following a banking crisis
on december 12 2008 president correa announced that ecuador would not pay $30.6 million in interest to lenders of a $510-million loan claiming that they were illegitimate in addition it claimed that $3.8 billion in foreign debt negotiated by previous administrations was illegitimate because it was authorised without executive decree at the time of the announcement the country had $5.65 billion in cash reserves http://www.worlddiplomacy.org states that since ecuador's president rafael correa won a third term in 2013 this should provide further stability and a good rate of growth for ecuador's economy.
=== industry ===
the country has potential for the industry in a variety of sectors including domestic production of raw materials and manufactured textiles mining chemical petrochemical and oil refinement power generation is also a potential sector that is starting to be developed due to ecuador's high water potential in various sectors of the country the development of products based on the melting or glass materials production and agro-processed foods and pharmaceutical production among others the most relevant project currently under development is the pacific refinery located in manta which will be one of the largest in the region
=== currency ===
in its infancy ecuador was part of gran colombia until 1830 as departamento del sur gran colombia's monetary regulations retained the old spanish colonial system ecuador officially began its own monetary unit on june 28 1835 when the inscription (rev.) el ecuador en colombia was changed to repblica del ecuador many regional coins from neighboring peru colombia bolivia etc. as well as international units were in circulation and accepted while quito fought counterfeiting and tried to unify its currency counterfeiting had reached alarming proportions during 1842 at this time ecuador was on the verge of bankruptcy and since legitimate coins had such imperfections it was impossible to tell them from the bad coins
on december 29 1845 president vicente ramn roca authorized a coin to compete with the fuertes (full-bodied coin) of other countries this was the peso fuerte the standard of 903 fineness for silver however resulted in a heavy export of the coin it disappeared as soon as it entered circulation (gresham's law) grabbed up by the merchants of guayaquil
by the 1850s the quito mint was not receiving enough precious metals to justify its operation it had to coin a minimum of 6,000 pesos a year just to meet overhead the mint was shut down temporarily during 1853 while the government considered the options of keeping it open or shutting it down permanently the mint equipment was worn and could not produce coins in sufficient quantity to compete with the foreign coin that entered ecuador
congress passed a new monetary law on december 5 1856 adopting the french decimal system a standard of 0.900 for silver and the ecuadorian franco the peso remained a unit of account equal to 5 francos paper money was first issued in 1859 by the banco de circulacin y descuento de manuel antonio de luzarraga in guayaquil with banknote denominations of 1 4 5 10 and 20 pesos
ecuador's monetary unit the peso was renamed sucre (decree of march 22 1884 effective april 1) the 1884 monetary law permitted free circulation of the gold coins of france italy switzerland colombia etc as for silver the law permitted the import of 5-franc pieces of france italy belgium and switzerland etc opper (velln) was made legal tender to 5 dcimos bank reserves were in silver coins and banknotes were convertible solely into silver ecuador was on a de facto silver standard and did not coin any gold between 1884 and 1892 president antonio flores jijn announced that from august 15 1890 only national coins were allowed to circulate in ecuador and ecuador's monetary system was unified
following the financial banking crisis of 1999 the u.s dollar became legal tender in ecuador on march 13 2000 and sucre notes ceased being legal tender on september 11 sucre notes remained exchangeable at banco central until march 30 2001 at 25,000 sucres per dollar ecuador now only issues its own centavo coins
== transport ==
the rehabilitation and reopening of the ecuadorian railroad and use of it as a tourist attraction is one of the recent developments in transportation matters
the roads of ecuador in recent years have undergone important improvement the major routes are pan american (under enhancement from four to six lanes from rumichaca to ambato the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of ambato and riobamba and running via riobamba to loja) in the absence of the section between loja and the border with peru there are the route espondilus and/or ruta del sol (oriented to travel along the ecuadorian coastline) and the amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the ecuadorian amazon linking most and more major cities of it)
another major project is developing the road manta tena the highway guayaquil salinas highway aloag santo domingo riobamba macas (which crosses sangay national park) other new developments include the national unity bridge complex in guayaquil the bridge over the napo river in francisco de orellana the esmeraldas river bridge in the city of the same name and perhaps the most remarkable of all the bahia san vincente bridge being the largest on the latin american pacific coast
the international airports of quito and guayaquil have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization in the case of guayaquil it involved a new air terminal once considered the best in south america and the best in latin america and in quito where an entire new airport has been built in tababela and was inaugurated in february 2013 with canadian assistance however the main road leading from quito city centre to the new airport will only be finished in late 2014 making current travelling from the airport to downtown quito as long as two hours during rush hour quito's old city-centre airport is being turned into parkland with some light industrial use
== electrical power outlets ==
electrical power outlets in ecuador are the same as in the us (110v)
== water supply and sanitation ==
drinking water supply and sanitation in ecuador is characterized by a number of achievements and challenges one key achievement is a significant increase in both access to an improved water source (82% in 1990 to 96% in 2010 in urban areas) and improved sanitation (77% in 1990 to 96% in 2010 in urban areas) significant increases in coverage in urban areas were achieved both by the public utility emaap-q serving the capital quito and the private concessionaire interagua in the country's largest city guayaquil however municipalities rely overwhelmingly upon central government investment rather than recouping the costs at a local level another problem is intermittent water supply which affects half of the urban areas also only 8% of all collected wastewater is being treated the level of non-revenue water is estimated at 65% one of the highest in latin america
== mobile (cellular) phone frequencies ==
mobile (cellular) phone frequencies in ecuador are 850 mhz 1900 mhz and 1700/2100 mhz (lte)
== demographics ==
ecuador's population is ethnically diverse and the 2011 estimates put ecuador's population at 15,007,343 the largest ethnic group (as of 2010) is the mestizos who are the descendants of spanish colonists that interbred with amerindian peoples and constitute about 71% of the population the white ecuadorians (white latin american) account for 6.1% of the population of ecuador and can be found throughout all of ecuador primarily around the urban areas even though ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from spain today ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of european immigrants predominantly from spain with people from italy france germany and switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority these include economically well off immigrants of lebanese and palestinian descent who are either christian or muslim (islam in ecuador) in addition there is a small european jewish (ecuadorian jews) population which is based mainly in quito and to a lesser extent in guayaquil.amerindians account for 7% of the current population the mostly rural montubio population of the coastal provinces of ecuador who might be classified as pardo account for 7.4% of the population the afro-ecuadorians is a minority population (7%) in ecuador that includes the mulattos and zambos and are largely based in the esmeraldas province and to a lesser degree in the predominantely mestizo provinces of coastal ecuador - guayas and manabi in the highland andes where a predominantely mestizo white and amerindian population exist the african presence is almost non existent except for a small community in the province of imbabura called chota valley
=== religion ===
according to the ecuadorian national institute of statistics and census 91.95% of the country's population have a religion 7.94% are atheists and 0.11% are agnostics among the people that have a religion 80.44% are roman catholic latin rite (see list of roman catholic dioceses in ecuador) 11.30% are protestants 1.29% are jehovah's witnesses and 6.97% other (mainly jewish buddhists and latter-day saints)
in the rural parts of ecuador amerindian beliefs and catholicism are sometimes syncretized most festivals and annual parades are based on religious celebrations many incorporating a mixture of rites and icons
there is a small number of eastern orthodox christians amerindian religions muslims (see islam in ecuador) buddhists and bah according to their own estimates the the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints accounts for about 1.4% of the population or 211,165 members at the end of 2012 according to their own sources in 2012 there were 77,323 jehovah's witnesses in the country
the first jews arrived in ecuador in the 16th and 17th centuries most of them are sephardic anusim (crypto-jews) and many still speak judaeo-spanish (ladino) language today the jewish community of ecuador (comunidad juda del ecuador) has its seat in quito and has approximately 200 members nevertheless this number is declining because young people leave the country for the united states or israel the community has a jewish center with a synagogue a country club and a cemetery it supports the albert einstein school where jewish history religion and hebrew classes are offered there are very small communities in cuenca the comunidad de culto israelita reunites the jews of guayaquil this community works independently from the jewish community of ecuador and is composed of only 30 people
=== nations ===
the ecuadorian constitution recognizes the pluri-nationality of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups thus in addition to criollos mestizos and afro-ecuadorians some people belong to the amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast quechua andean villages and the amazonian jungle
=== population genetics ===
according to a 2015 genealogical dna testing the average ecuadorian is estimated to be 52.96% native american 41.77% european and 5.26% sub-saharan african overall
=== population density ===

population cities (2010)
status according to the 2010 census
=== immigration and emigration ===
a small east asian latino community estimated at 2,500 mainly consists of those of japanese and chinese descent whose ancestors arrived as miners farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century
in the early years of world war ii ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants and in 1939 when several south american countries refused to accept 165 jewish refugees from germany aboard the ship koenigstein ecuador granted them entry permits
in recent years ecuador has grown in popularity among north american expatriates they're drawn there by the authentic cultural experience and beautiful natural surroundings also ecuador's favorable residency options make for an easy transition for those who decide to settle there indefinitely
another perk that draws many expats to ecuador is its low cost of living since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in north america it's a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget
even real estate in ecuador is much less than its tropical counterparts however as more and more north americans are discovering ecuador's potential property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists
== culture ==
ecuador's mainstream culture is defined by its hispanic mestizo majority and like their ancestry it is traditionally of spanish heritage influenced in different degrees by amerindian traditions and in some cases by african elements the first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to ecuador consisted of spanish colonists following the arrival of europeans in 1499 a lower number of other europeans and north americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and in smaller numbers poles lithuanians english irish and croats during and after the second world war
since african slavery was not the workforce of the spanish colonies in the andes mountains given the subjugation of the amerindian people through proselytization and encomiendas the minority population of african descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of esmeraldas this is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of ecuador the few black african survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of anton the chief of the group where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the andean region a little later runaway slaves from colombia known as cimarrones joined them in the small chota valley of the province of imbabura exist a small community of africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population these blacks are descendants of africans who were brought over from colombia by jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves as a general rule small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in loja zaruma and zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of guayaquil today you can find a small community of africans in the catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of loja
ecuador's amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees but some may also practice their own native cultures particularly the more remote amerindian communities of the amazon basin spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98% part of ecuador's population can speak amerindian languages in some cases as a second language two percent of the population speak only amerindian languages
=== language ===
most ecuadorians speak spanish though many speak amerindian language such as kichwa (also spelt quichua) which is one of the quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in ecuador colombia and peru other amerindian languages spoken in ecuador include awapit (spoken by the aw) a'ingae (spoken by the cofan) shuar chicham (spoken by the shuar) achuar-shiwiar (spoken by the achuar and the shiwiar) cha'palaachi (spoken by the chachi) tsa'fiki (spoken by the tschila) paicoca (spoken by the siona and secoya) and wao tededeo (spoken by the waorani) though most features of ecuadorian spanish are those universal to the spanish-speaking world there are several idiosyncrasies

in the coastal region seafood is very popular with fish shrimp and ceviche being key parts of the diet generally ceviches are served with fried plantain (chifles y patacones) popcorn or tostado plantain- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular churrasco is a staple food of the coastal region especially guayaquil arroz con menestra y carne asada (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of guayaquil as is fried plantain which is often served with it this region is a leading producer of bananas cacao beans (to make chocolate) shrimp tilapia mangos and passion fruit among other products
in the amazon region a dietary staple is the yuca elsewhere called cassava many fruits are available in this region including bananas tree grapes and peach palms
=== literature ===
early literature in colonial ecuador as in the rest of spanish america was influenced by the spanish golden age one of the earliest examples is jacinto collahuazo an amerindian chief of a northern village in today's ibarra born in the late 1600s despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the spanish collahuazo learned to read and write in castilian but his work was written in quechua the use of quipu was banned by the spanish and in order to preserve their work many inca poets had to resort to the use of the latin alphabet to write in their native quechua language the history behind the inca drama ollantay the oldest literary piece in existence for any amerindian language in america shares some similarities with the work of collahuazo collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned the existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in quito and found a hidden manuscript the salvaged fragment is a spanish translation from quechua of the elegy to the dead of atahualpa a poem written by collahuazo which describes the sadness and impotence of the inca people of having lost their king atahualpa
other early ecuadorian writers include the jesuits juan bautista aguirre born in daule in 1725 and father juan de velasco born in riobamba in 1727 de velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the kingdom of quito (today ecuador) before the arrival of the spanish his historical accounts are nationalistic featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history

== health ==
the current structure of the ecuadorian public health care system dates back to 1967 the ministry of the public health (ministerio de salud pblica del ecuador) is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policies and health care plans the minister of public health is appointed directly by the president of the republic the current minister or ecuadorian general surgeon is carina vance
the philosophy of the ministry of public health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine
the public healthcare system allows patients to be treated without an appointment in public general hospitals by general practitioners and specialists in the outpatient clinic (consulta externa) at no cost this is done in the four basic specialties of pediatric gynecology clinic medicine and surgery there are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases target a particular group of the population or provide better treatment in some medical specialties some examples in this group are the gynecologic hospitals or maternities children hospitals geriatric hospitals and oncology institutes
although well-equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of provinces there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and canton cities for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics gynecology clinical medicine and surgery
community health care centers (centros de salud) are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas these are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours the doctors assigned to rural communities where the amerindian population can be substantial have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities the treatment in this case respects the culture of the community
the public healthcare system should not be confused with the ecuadorian social security healthcare service which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers citizens with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system the ecuadorian institute of social security (iess) has several major hospitals and medical sub-centers under its administration across the nation
ecuador currently ranks 20 in most efficient health care countries compared to 111 back in the year 2000 ecuadorians have a life expectancy of 75.6 years the infant mortality rate is 13 per 1,000 live births a major improvement from approximately 76 in the early 1980s and 140 in 1950 23% of children under five are chronically malnourished population in some rural areas have no access to potable water and its supply is provided by mean of water tankers there are 686 malaria cases per 100,000 people basic health care including doctor's visits basic surgeries and basic medications has been provided free since 2008 however some public hospitals are in poor condition and often lack necessary supplies to attend the high demand of patients private hospitals and clinics are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population
== education ==
the ecuadorian constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a basic level of education which is estimated at nine school years in 1996 the net primary enrollment rate was 96.9% and 71.8% of children stayed in school until the fifth grade the cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs
provision of public schools falls far below the levels needed and class sizes are often very large and families of limited means often find it necessary to pay for education in rural areas only 10% of the children go on to high school the ministry of education states that the mean number of years completed is 6.7
ecuador has 61 universities many of which still confer terminal degrees according to the traditional spanish education system honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the americas university of san fulgencio founded in 1586 by the augustines san gregorio magno university founded in 1651 by the jesuits and university of santo toms of aquino founded in 1681 by the dominican order
among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering physics chemistry or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes these terminal degrees as in the case of the phd in other countries were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher in the professional realm a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual
however in 2004 the national council of higher education (conesup) started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts the new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects credits or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas the terminal degree in law previously known as jd juris doctor (doctor en jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of abogado (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree in the same fashion for medical school the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of md in medicine and surgery) to almost five with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore and it is given with the title of mdico (medic) therefore an md or phd in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts nonetheless a mdico can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician
this new reorganization although very ambitious lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions one of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians as today a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign phd to attain or retain the status of rector (president of a university) or dcano (dean) for ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country these regulations sounded illogical disappointing and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement
a debate to modify this and other reforms specially the one which granted control of the higher education system by the government was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan national assembly on august 4 2010 but vetoed by president rafael correa who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and senplades (national secretary of planning and development) due to this change there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree and fewer than 5% have a phd (although many of them already have ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees)
about 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training
== sciences and research ==
ecuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology the most notable icons in ecuadorian sciences are the mathematician and cartographer pedro vicente maldonado born in riobamba in 1707 and the printer independence precursor and medical pioneer eugenio espejo born in 1747 in quito among other notable ecuadorian scientists and engineers are lieutenant jose rodriguez lavandera a pioneer who built the first submarine in latin america in 1837 reinaldo espinosa aguilar (18981950) a botanist and biologist of andean flora and jos aurelio dueas (18801961) a chemist and inventor of a method of textile serigraphy
the major areas of scientific research in ecuador have been in the medical fields tropical and infectious diseases treatments agricultural engineering pharmaceutical research and bioengineering being a small country and a consumer of foreign technology ecuador has favored research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology the antivirus program checkprogram banking protection system mdlock and core banking software cobis are products of ecuadorian development
the scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around physics statistics and partial differential equations in mathematics in the case of engineering fields the majority of scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions escuela superior politcnica del litoral - espol universidad de las fuerzas armadas - espe and escuela politcnica nacional epn
epn is known for research and education in the applied science astronomy atmospheric physics engineering and physical sciences the geophysics institute monitors over the country's volcanoes in the andes mountains of ecuador and in the galpagos islands all of which is part of the ring of fire epn adopted the polytechnic university model that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering
the oldest observatory in south america is the quito astronomical observatory and is located in quito ecuador the quito astronomical observatory which gives the global community of a virtual telescope system that is connected via the internet and allows the world to watch by streaming is managed by epn
contemporary ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are eugenia del pino (born 1945) the first ecuadorian to be elected to the united states national academy of science and arturo villavicencio who was part of the working group of the ipcc which shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with al gore for their dissemination of the effects of climate change
currently the politics of research and investigation are managed by the national secretary of higher education science and technology (senescyt)
