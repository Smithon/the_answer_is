cumulonimbus from the latin cumulus ("heap") and nimbus ("rainstorm storm cloud") is a dense towering vertical cloud associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents cumulonimbus can form alone in clusters or along cold front squall lines these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather such as tornadoes cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb and are designated in the d2 family
== appearanceedit ==
towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds the cumulonimbus base may extend several miles across and occupy low to middle altitudes- formed at altitude from approximately 200 to 4,000 m (700 to 10,000 ft) peaks typically reach to as much as 6,000 m (20,000 ft) with extreme instances as high as 23,000 m (75,000 ft) well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat anvil-like top (anvil dome) caused by wind shear or inversion near the tropopause the shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud's vertical component for many miles and be accompanied by lightning occasionally rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level when vertically developed this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison
=== speciesedit ===
cumulonimbus calvus cloud with puffy top similar to cumulus congestus which it develops from under the correct conditions in can become a cumulonimbus capillatus
cumulonimbus capillatus  cloud with cirrus-like fibrous-edged top
cumulonimbus incus  cloud with anvil top
=== supplementary featuresedit ===
==== accessory cloudsedit ====
arcus (including roll and shelf clouds) low horizontal cloud formation associated with the leading edge of thunderstorm outflow
pannus accompanied by a lower layer of fractus species cloud forming in precipitation
pileus (species calvus only) small cap-like cloud over parent cumulonimbus
velum a thin horizontal sheet that forms around the middle of a cumulonimbus
==== supplementary featuresedit ====
incus (species capillatus only) cumulonimbus with flat anvil-like cirriform top caused by wind shear where the rising air currents hit the inversion layer at the tropopause
mamma or mammatus consisting of bubble-like protrusions on the underside
tuba column hanging from the cloud base which can develop into a funnel cloud or tornado they are known to drop very low sometimes just 20 feet above ground level
==== precipitation-based supplementary featuresedit ====
rain precipitation that reaches the ground as liquid
virga precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground
== effectsedit ==
cumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential rain of a convective nature and flash flooding as well as straight-line winds most storm cells die after about 20 minutes when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft causing the energy to dissipate if there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere however (on a hot summer's day for example) the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidlyresulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one this can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms (called blizzards") which bring lightning thunder and torrential snow however cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions
== life cycle or stagesedit ==
in general cumulonimbus require moisture an unstable air mass and a lifting force (heat) in order to form cumulonimbus typically go through three stages the developing stage the mature stage (where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions) and the dissipation stage the average thunderstorm has a 24 km (15 mi) diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through
== cloud typesedit ==
clouds form when the dewpoint of water is reached in the presence of condensation nuclei in the troposphere the atmosphere is a dynamic system and the local conditions of turbulence uplift and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized furthermore some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as wave clouds or actinoform clouds these are large-scale structures and are not always readily identifiable from single point of view
