in the law enforcement jargon a suspect is a known person accused or suspected of committing a crime police and reporters in the united states often use the word suspect as a jargon when referring to the perpetrator of the offense (perp in dated us slang) however in official definition the perpetrator is the robber assailant counterfeiter etc.the person who actually committed the crime the distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not known to have committed the offense while the perpetratorwho may not yet have been suspected of the crime and is thus not necessarily a suspectis the one who actually did the suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator or there may have been no actual crime which would mean there is no perpetrator
a common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator while a mug shot is of suspect) frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect when there is no suspect the police could be looking for a suspect but they are surely looking for the perpetrator and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not
possibly because of the misuse of suspect to mean perpetrator police in the early 21st century began to use person of interest possible suspect and even possible person of interest to mean suspect
under the judicial systems of the u.s. once a decision is approved to arrest a suspect or bind him over for trial either by a prosecutor issuing an information a grand jury issuing a true bill or indictment or a judge issuing an arrest warrant the suspect can then be properly called a defendant or the accused only after being convicted is the suspect properly called the perpetrator
