the north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the northern hemisphere where the earth's axis of rotation meets its surface it should not be confused with the north magnetic pole
the north pole is the northernmost point on the earth lying diametrically opposite the south pole it defines geodetic latitude 90 north as well as the direction of true north at the north pole all directions point south all lines of longitude converge there so its longitude can be defined as any degree value along tight latitude circles counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west
while the south pole lies on a continental land mass the north pole is located in the middle of the arctic ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice this makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the north pole (unlike the south pole) however the soviet union and later russia constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937 some of which have passed over or very close to the pole since 2002 the russians have also annually established a base barneo close to the pole this operates for a few weeks during early spring studies in the 2000s predicted that the north pole may become seasonally ice-free because of arctic ice shrinkage with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later
the sea depth at the north pole has been measured at 4,261 m (13,980 ft) by the russian mir submersible in 2007 and at 4,087 m (13,410 ft) by uss nautilus in 1958 the nearest land is usually said to be kaffeklubben island off the northern coast of greenland about 700 km (430 mi) away though some perhaps non-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer the nearest permanently inhabited place is alert in the qikiqtaaluk region nunavut canada which is located 817 km (508 mi) from the pole
== precise definition ==
the earth's axis of rotation and hence the position of the north pole was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the earth) until in the 18th century the mathematician leonhard euler predicted that the axis might wobble slightly around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent variation of latitude, as determined for a fixed point on earth from the observation of stars part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the pole across the earth's surface by a range of a few meters the wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component the component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the 8 month wandering predicted by euler and is now called the chandler wobble after its discoverer the exact point of intersection of the earth's axis and the earth's surface at any given moment is called the instantaneous pole but because of the wobble this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed north pole (or south pole) when metre-scale precision is required
it is desirable to tie the system of earth coordinates (latitude longitude and elevations or orography) to fixed landforms of course given plate tectonics and isostasy there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed yet the international earth rotation and reference systems service and the international astronomical union have defined a framework called the international terrestrial reference system

=== pre-1900 ===
as early as the 16th century many eminent people correctly believed that the north pole was in a sea which in the 19th century was called the polynya or open polar sea it was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year several expeditions set out to find the way generally with whaling ships already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes
one of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the north pole was that of british naval officer william edward parry who in 1827 reached latitude 8245 north in 1871 the polaris expedition a us attempt on the pole led by charles francis hall ended in disaster another british royal navy attempt on the pole part of the british arctic expedition by commander albert h markham reached a then-record 8320'26 north in may 1876 before turning back an 18791881 expedition commanded by us naval officer george w delong ended tragically when their ship the uss jeanette was crushed by ice over half the crew including delong were lost
in april 1895 the norwegian explorers fridtjof nansen and hjalmar johansen struck out for the pole on skis after leaving nansen's icebound ship fram the pair reached latitude 8614 north before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards eventually reaching franz josef land
in 1897 swedish engineer salomon august andre and two companions tried to reach the north pole in the hydrogen balloon rnen ("eagle") but came down 300 km (190 mi) north of kvitya the northeasternmost part of the svalbard archipelago they trekked to kvitya but died there three months later in 1930 the remains of this expedition were found by the norwegian bratvaag expedition
the italian explorer luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi and captain umberto cagni of the italian royal navy (regia marina) sailed the converted whaler stella polare ("pole star") from norway in 1899 on 11 march 1900 cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86 34 on 25 april setting a new record by beating nansen's result of 1895 by 35 to 40 km (22 to 25 mi) cagni barely managed to return to the camp remaining there until 23 june on 16 august the stella polare left rudolf island heading south and the expedition returned to norway
=== 19001940 ===
the us explorer frederick cook claimed to have reached the north pole on 21 april 1908 with two inuit men ahwelah and etukishook but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted
the conquest of the north pole was for many years credited to us navy engineer robert peary who claimed to have reached the pole on 6 april 1909 accompanied by matthew henson and four inuit men ootah seeglo egingwah and ooqueah however peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial those who accompanied peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the pole
the distances and speeds that peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point peary's account of a journey to the pole and back while traveling along the direct line the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing is contradicted by henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridges and open leads
the british explorer wally herbert initially a supporter of peary researched peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records he concluded that peary had not reached the pole support for peary came again in 2005 however when british explorer tom avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and canadian eskimo dog teams reaching the north pole in 36 days 22 hours nearly five hours faster than peary however avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles significantly short of the 135 claimed by peary avery writes on his web site that the admiration and respect which i hold for robert peary matthew henson and the four inuit men who ventured north in 1909 has grown enormously since we set out from cape columbia having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice i am more convinced than ever that peary did indeed discover the north pole.
another rejection of peary's claim arrived in 2009 when e myles standish of the california institute of technology an experienced referee of scientific claims reported numerous alleged lacunae and inconsistencies
the first claimed flight over the pole was made on 9 may 1926 by us naval officer richard e byrd and pilot floyd bennett in a fokker tri-motor aircraft although verified at the time by a committee of the national geographic society this claim has since been undermined by the 1996 revelation that byrd's long-hidden diary's solar sextant data (which the ngs never checked) consistently contradict his june 1926 report's parallel data by over 100 mi (160 km) the secret report's alleged en-route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later (while the original version was hidden for 70 years) a realization first published in 2000 by the university of cambridge after scrupulous refereeing
according to standish anyone who is acquainted with the facts and has any amount of logical reasoning can not avoid the conclusion that neither cook nor peary nor byrd reached the north pole and they all knew it.
the first consistent verified and scientifically convincing attainment of the pole was on 12 may 1926 by norwegian explorer roald amundsen and his us sponsor lincoln ellsworth from the airship norge norge though norwegian-owned was designed and piloted by the italian umberto nobile the flight started from svalbard in norway and crossed the arctic ocean to alaska nobile with several scientists and crew from the norge overflew the pole a second time on 24 may 1928 in the airship italia the italia crashed on its return from the pole with the loss of half the crew
in may 1937 the world's first north pole ice station north pole-1 was established by soviet scientists by air 20 kilometres (13 mi) from the north pole the expedition members oceanographer pyotr shirshov meteorologist yevgeny fyodorov radio operator ernst krenkel and the leader ivan papanin conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months by 19 february 1938 when the group was picked up by the ice breakers taimyr and murman their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of greenland
=== 19402000 ===
in may 1945 an raf lancaster of the aries expedition became the first commonwealth aircraft to overfly the north geographic and north magnetic poles the plane was piloted by david cecil mckinley of the royal air force it carried an 11-man crew with kenneth c maclure of the royal canadian air force in charge of all scientific observations in 2006 maclure was honoured with a spot in canada's aviation hall of fame
discounting peary's disputed claim the first men to set foot at the north pole were a soviet party including geophysicists mikhail ostrekin and pavel senko oceanographers mikhail somov and pavel gordienko and other scientists and flight crew (24 people in total) of aleksandr kuznetsov's sever-2 expedition (marchmay 1948) it was organized by the chief directorate of the northern sea route the party flew on three planes (pilots ivan cherevichnyy vitaly maslennikov and ilya kotov) from kotelny island to the north pole and landed there at 4:44pm (moscow time utc+04:00) on 23 april 1948 they established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations on 26 april the expedition flew back to the continent
next year on 9 may 1949 two other soviet scientists (vitali volovich and andrei medvedev) became the first people to parachute onto the north pole they jumped from a douglas c-47 skytrain registered cccp h-369
on 3 may 1952 u.s air force lieutenant colonel joseph o fletcher and lieutenant william pershing benedict along with scientist albert p crary landed a modified douglas c-47 skytrain at the north pole some western sources considered this to be the first landing at the pole until the soviet landings became widely known
the united states navy submarine uss nautilus (ssn-571) crossed the north pole on 3 august 1958 on 17 march 1959 uss skate (ssn-578) surfaced at the pole breaking through the ice above it becoming the first naval vessel to do so
setting aside peary's claim the first confirmed surface conquest of the north pole was that of ralph plaisted walt pederson gerry pitzl and jean luc bombardier who traveled over the ice by snowmobile and arrived on 19 april 1968 the united states air force independently confirmed their position
on 6 april 1969 wally herbert and companions allan gill roy koerner and kenneth hedges of the british trans-arctic expedition became the first men to reach the north pole on foot (albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops) they continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the arctic ocean and by its longest axis barrow alaska to svalbard a feat that has never been repeated because of suggestions (later proven false) of plaisted's use of air transport some sources classify herbert's expedition as the first confirmed to reach the north pole over the ice surface by any means in the 1980s plaisted's pilots weldy phipps and ken lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided it is also said that herbert was the first person to reach the pole of inaccessibility
on 17 august 1977 the soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker arktika completed the first surface vessel journey to the north pole
in 1982 ranulph fiennes and charles r burton became the first people to cross the arctic ocean in a single season they departed from cape crozier ellesmere island on 17 february 1982 and arrived at the geographic north pole on 10 april 1982 they travelled on foot and snowmobile from the pole they travelled towards svalbard but due to the unstable nature of the ice ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days they were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship mv benjamin bowring and boarded it on 4 august 1982 at position 80:31n 00:59w as a result of this journey which formed a section of the three-year transglobe expedition 19791982 fiennes and burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both north and south poles by surface travel alone this achievement remains unchallenged to this day
in 1985 sir edmund hillary (the first man to stand on the summit of mount everest) and neil armstrong (the first man to stand on the moon) landed at the north pole in a small twin-engined ski plane hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of everest
in 1986 will steger with seven teammates became the first to be confirmed as reaching the pole by dogsled and without resupply
on 6 may 1986 uss archerfish (ssn 678) uss ray (ssn 653) and uss hawkbill (ssn 666) surfaced at the north pole the first tri-submarine surfacing at the north pole
on 21 april 1987 shinji kazama of japan became the first person to reach the north pole on a motorcycle
on 18 may 1987 uss billfish (ssn 676) uss sea devil (ssn 664) and hms superb (s 109) surfaced at the north pole the first international surfacing at the north pole
in 1988 a 13-man strong team (9 soviets 4 canadians) skied across the arctic from siberia to northern canada one of the canadians richard weber became the first person to reach the pole from both sides of the arctic ocean
on 4 may 1990 brge ousland and erling kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the north pole unsupported after a 58-day ski trek from ellesmere island in canada a distance of 800 km
on 7 september 1991 the german research vessel polarstern and the swedish icebreaker oden reached the north pole as the first conventional powered vessels both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10 years later with the healy
in 1998 1999 and 2000 lada niva marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by bronto lada/vaz's experimental product division) were driven to the north pole the 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the north pole the 2000 expedition departed from a russian research base around 114 km from the pole and claimed an average speed of 2015 km/h in an average temperature of 30 degrees
=== 21st century ===
in recent years journeys to the north pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the north pole in recent years the temporary seasonal russian camp of barneo has been established by air a short distance from the pole annually since 2002 and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties trips from the camp to the pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter
the first attempt at underwater exploration of the north pole was made on 22 april 1998 by russian firefighter and diver andrei rozhkov with the support of the diving club of moscow state university but ended in fatality the next attempted dive at the north pole was organized the next year by the same diving club and ended in success on 24 april 1999 the divers were michael wolff (austria) brett cormick (uk) and bob wass (usa)
in 2005 the united states navy submarine uss charlotte (ssn-766) surfaced through 155 cm (61 in) of ice at the north pole and spent 18 hours there
in july 2007 british endurance swimmer lewis gordon pugh completed a 1 km (0.62 mi) swim at the north pole his feat undertaken to highlight the effects of global warming took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes his later attempt to paddle a kayak to the north pole in late 2008 following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the pole was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days the expedition was then abandoned
by september 2007 the north pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships 54 times by soviet and russian icebreakers 4 times by swedish oden 3 times by german polarstern 3 times by uscgc healy and uscgc polar sea and once by ccgs louis s st-laurent and by swedish vidar viking
==== 2007 descent to the north pole seabed ====
on 2 august 2007 a russian scientific expedition arktika 2007 made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the north pole to a depth of 4.3 km (2.7 mi) as part of the research programme in support of russia's 2001 extended continental shelf claim to a large swathe of the arctic ocean floor the descent took place in two mir submersibles and was led by soviet and russian polar explorer artur chilingarov in a symbolic act of visitation the russian flag was placed on the ocean floor exactly under the pole
the expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give russia a dominant influence in the arctic according to the new york times the warming arctic climate and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries such as china and the united states toward the top of the world where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable
==== mlae 2009 expedition ====
in 2009 the russian marine live-ice automobile expeditionmlae 2009 (vasily elagin as a leader and a team of sergey larin afanasy makovnev vladimir obikhod alexey ushakov alexey shkrabkin and nikolay nikulshin) reached the north pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire atvsyemelya 1 and yemelya 2designed by vasily elagin a known russian mountain climber explorer and engineer the vehicles reached the north pole on 26 april 2009 17:30 (moscow time) the expedition was supported by the russian geographical society the russian book of records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip to the geographical north pole
==== mlae 2013 expedition ====
on 1 march 2013 the russian marine live-ice automobile expedition mlae 2013 (vasily elagin as a leader and a team of andrey vankov sergey isayev nikolay kozlov afanasy makovnev vladimir obikhod and alexey shkrabkin) on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire atvsyemelya 3 and yemelya 4started from golomyanny island (the severnaya zemlya archipelago) to the north pole across drifting ice of the arctic ocean the vehicles reached the pole on 6 april and then continued to the canadian coast the coast was reached on 30 april 2013 (8308n 07559w) and on 5 may 2013 the expedition finished in resolute bay nu the way between the russian borderland (machtovyi island of the severnaya zemlya archipelago 8015n 09727e) and the canadian coast (8308n 07559w) took 55 days it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total the expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies the expedition was supported by the russian geographical society
== day and night ==
the sun at the north pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter sunrise is just before the march equinox (around 20 march) the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23 elevation at the summer solstice (around 21 june) after which time it begins to sink reaching sunset just after the september equinox (around 23 september) when the sun is visible in the polar sky it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon this circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox
a civil twilight period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset
these effects are caused by a combination of the earth's axial tilt and its revolution around the sun the direction of the earth's axial tilt as well as its angle relative to the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods) at northern midsummer the north pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent as the year progresses and the earth moves around the sun the north pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the sun to its maximum extent a similar sequence is observed at the south pole with a six-month time difference
== time ==
in most places on earth local time is determined by longitude such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example at midday the sun is roughly at its highest) this line of reasoning fails at the north pole where the sun rises and sets only once per year and all lines of longitude and hence all time zones converge there is no permanent human presence at the north pole and no particular time zone has been assigned polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient such as greenwich mean time or the time zone of the country from which they departed
== climate ==
the north pole is substantially warmer than the south pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat) rather than at altitude on a continental land mass
winter (january) temperatures at the north pole can range from about 47 to 13 c (53 to 9 f) averaging around 31 c (24 f) summer temperatures (june july and august) average around the freezing point (0 c (32 f)) the highest temperature yet recorded is 13 c (55 f) much warmer than the south pole's record high of only 12.3 c (9.9 f)
the sea ice at the north pole is typically around 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) thick although ice thickness its spatial extent and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years it is likely that global warming has contributed to this but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the arctic reports have also predicted that within a few decades the arctic ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer this may have significant commercial implications see territorial claims, below
the retreat of the arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation and may have serious climate implications by contributing to arctic cyclone generation
== flora and fauna ==
polar bears are believed rarely to travel beyond about 82 north owing to the scarcity of food though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the north pole and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1 mi (1.6 km) from the pole the ringed seal has also been seen at the pole and arctic foxes have been observed less than 60 km (37 mi) away at 8940 n
birds seen at or very near the pole include the snow bunting northern fulmar and black-legged kittiwake though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions
fish have been seen in the waters at the north pole but these are probably few in number a member of the russian team that descended to the north pole seabed in august 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there however it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimps and amphipods
== territorial claims to the north pole and arctic regions ==
currently under international law no country owns the north pole or the region of the arctic ocean surrounding it the five surrounding arctic countries russian federation (the biggest country) canada norway denmark (via greenland) and the united states are limited to a 200-nautical-mile (370 km 230 mi) exclusive economic zone around their coasts and the area beyond that is administered by the international seabed authority
upon ratification of the united nations convention on the law of the sea a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone if validated such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone norway (ratified the convention in 1996) russia (ratified in 1997) canada (ratified in 2003) and denmark (ratified in 2004) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation
in 1907 canada invoked a sector principle to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the north pole this claim has not been relinquished but was not consistently pressed until 2013
however in 2014 denmark claimed part of the sea bed including the north pole
== cultural associations ==
in some western cultures the geographic north pole is described as the location of santa claus workshop and residence although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic north pole canada post has assigned postal code h0h 0h0 to the north pole (referring to santa's traditional exclamation of ho ho ho!")
this association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of hyperborea that posits the north pole the otherworldly world-axis as the abode of god and superhuman beings the popular figure of the pole-dwelling santa claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence
as henry corbin has documented the north pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of sufism and iranian mysticism the orient sought by the mystic the orient that cannot be located on our maps is in the direction of the north beyond the north.
owing to its remoteness the pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient islamic tradition called mount qaf (jabal qaf) the farthest point of the earth according to certain authors the jabal qaf of muslim cosmology is a version of rupes nigra a mountain whose ascent like dante's climbing of the mountain of purgatory represents the pilgrim's progress through spiritual states in iranian theosophy the heavenly pole the focal point of the spiritual ascent acts as a magnet to draw beings to its palaces ablaze with immaterial matter.
