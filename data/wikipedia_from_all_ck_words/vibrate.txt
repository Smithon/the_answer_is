earth science or geoscience is an all-encompassing term that refers to the fields of science dealing with planet earth it can be considered to be a branch of planetary science but with a much older history there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to earth sciences the formal discipline of earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere typically earth scientists will use tools from physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how the earth system works and how it evolved to its current state
== fields of studyedit ==
the following fields of science are generally categorized within the earth sciences
geography specifically physical geography covers aspects of geomorphology soil study hydrology meteorology climatology and biogeography
geology describes the rocky parts of the earth's crust (or lithosphere) and its historic development major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology geochemistry geomorphology paleontology stratigraphy structural geology engineering geology and sedimentology
geophysics and geodesy investigate the shape of the earth its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields geophysicists explore the earth's core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of geologists in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration see geophysical survey
soil science covers the outermost layer of the earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or pedosphere) major subdisciplines include edaphology and pedology
ecology covers the interactions between the biota with their natural environment this field of study differentiates the study of the earth from the study of other planets in our solar system the earth being the only planet teeming with life
hydrology (includes oceanography and limnology) describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the earth (or hydrosphere) major subdisciplines include hydrogeology and physical chemical and biological oceanography
glaciology covers the icy parts of the earth (or cryosphere)
atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the earth (or atmosphere) between the surface and the exosphere (about 1000 km) major subdisciplines include meteorology climatology atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics
== earth's interioredit ==
plate tectonics mountain ranges volcanoes and earthquakes are geological phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the earth's crust
beneath the earth's crust lies the mantle which is heated by the radioactive decay of heavy elements the mantle is not quite solid and consists of magma which is in a state of semi-perpetual convection this convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move albeit slowly the resulting process is known as plate tectonics
plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the earth is resurfaced through a process called seafloor spreading new crust is created by the flow of magma from underneath the lithosphere to the surface through fissures where it cools and solidifies through a process called subduction oceanic crust is pushed underground beneath the rest of the lithospherewhere it comes into contact with magma and meltsrejoining the mantle from which it originally came
areas of the crust where new crust is created are called divergent boundaries those where it is brought back into the earth are convergent boundaries and those where plates slide past each other but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed are referred to as transform (or conservative) boundaries earthquakes result from the movement of the lithospheric plates and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the earth as part of subduction
volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material crust material that is forced into the asthenosphere melts and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surfacegiving birth to volcanoes
== earth's electromagnetic fieldedit ==
an electromagnet is a magnet that is created by a current that flows around a soft iron core earth has a solid iron inner core surrounded by semi-liquid materials of the outer core that move in continuous currents around the inner core therefore the earth is an electromagnet this is referred to as the dynamo theory of earth's magnetism
== earth's atmosphereedit ==
the troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere and exosphere are the five layers which make up earth's atmosphere in all the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% nitrogen 20.9% oxygen and 0.92% argon 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere the bottom-most layer the remaining one percent of the atmosphere (all but the nitrogen oxygen and argon) contains small amounts of other gases including co2 and water vapors water vapors and co2 allow the earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the sun's energy through a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect this allows earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life
the magnetic field created by the internal motions of the core produces the magnetosphere which protects the earth's atmosphere from the solar wind as the earth is 4.5 billion years old it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere
in addition to storing heat the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding the earth's surface from cosmic rays note that the level of protection is high enough to prevent cosmic rays from destroying all life on earth yet low enough to aid the mutations that have an important role in pushing forward diversity in the biosphere
== methodologyedit ==
methodologies vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied studies typically fall into one of three categories observational experimental or theoretical earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or go to many of the world's most exotic locations to study earth phenomena (e.g antarctica or hot spot island chains)
a foundational idea within the study earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism uniformitarianism dictates that ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed. in other words any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time this enables those who study earth's history to apply knowledge of how earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout deep history
== earth's spheresedit ==
earth science generally recognizes four spheres the lithosphere the hydrosphere the atmosphere and the biosphere these correspond to rocks water air and life also included by some are the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere
