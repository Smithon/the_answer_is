the metre american spelling meter (from the greek noun  measure") is the base unit of length in the international system of units (si) the si unit symbol is m the metre is defined as the distance travelled by light in a specific fraction about one three-hundred millionth of a second
the metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole in 1889 it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was subsequently changed twice) in 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 in 1983 the current definition was adopted in 1959 the imperial inch was re-defined as 0.0254 metres (2.54 centimetres or 25.4 millimetres) one metre is about 3 38 inches longer than a yard i.e about 39 38 inches
== spellingedit ==
metre is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in all english-speaking nations except the usa which uses meter
measuring devices (such as ammeter speedometer) are spelled -meter in all countries the word meter signifying any such device has the same derivation as the word metre denoting the unit of length
== etymologyedit ==
the etymological roots of metre can be traced to the greek verb (metreo) (to measure count or compare) and noun (metron) (a measure) which were used for physical measurement for poetic metre and by extension for moderation or avoiding extremism (as in be measured in your response") this range of uses is also found in latin (metior mensura) french (mtre mesure) english and other languages the motto (metro chro) in the seal of the international bureau of weights and measures (bimp) which was a saying of the greek statesman and philosopher pittacus of mytilene and may be translated as use measure! thus calls for both measurement and moderation
== history of definitionedit ==
in 1668 the english cleric and philosopher john wilkins proposed in an essay a decimal-based unit of length the universal measure or standard in 1670 gabriel mouton bishop of lyon also suggested a universal length standard with decimal multiples and divisions to be based on a one-minute angle of the earth's meridian arc or (as the earth's circumference was not easy to measure) on a pendulum with a one-second period in 1675 the italian scientist tito livio burattini in his work misura universale used the phrase metro cattolico ("universal measure") derived from the greek (mtron katholikn) to denote the standard unit of length derived from a pendulum as a result of the french revolution the french academy of sciences charged a commission with determining a single scale for all measures on 7 october 1790 that commission advised the adoption of a decimal system and on 19 march 1791 advised the adoption of the term mtre ("measure") a basic unit of length which they defined as equal to one ten-millionth of the distance between the north pole and the equator in 1793 the french national convention adopted the proposal this use of metre in english began at least as early as 1797
=== pendularedit ===
in 1668 wilkins proposed using christopher wren's suggestion of defining the metre using a pendulum with a length which produced a half-period of one second known as a seconds pendulum christiaan huygens had observed that length to be 38 rijnland inches or 39.26 english inches this is the equivalent of what is now known to be 997 mm no official action was taken regarding this suggestion
=== meridionaledit ===
in the 18th century there were two approaches to the definition of the standard unit of length one favoured wilkins approach to define the metre in terms of the length of a pendulum which produced a half-period of one second the other approach was to define the metre as one ten-millionth (1/10 000 000) of the length of a quadrant along the earth's meridian that is the distance from the equator to the north pole this means that the quadrant (a section/distance 14 of the earth's circumference) would have been defined as exactly 10 000 000 metres (10 000 km) at that time with the total circumference of the earth defined as 40 000 000 metres (40 000 km) in 1791 the french academy of sciences selected the meridional definition over the pendular definition because the force of gravity varies slightly over the surface of the earth which affects the period of a pendulum
to establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of the metre more accurate measurements of this meridian were needed the french academy of sciences commissioned an expedition led by jean baptiste joseph delambre and pierre mchain lasting from 1792 to 1799 which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in dunkerque and montjuc castle in barcelona to estimate the length of the meridian arc through dunkerque this portion of the meridian assumed to be the same length as the paris meridian was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian connecting the north pole with the equator the problem with this approach is that the exact shape of the earth is not a simple mathematical shape such as a sphere or oblate spheroid at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length the irregular and particular shape of the earth smoothed to sea level is called a geoid which literally means earth-shaped but does not correspond to the actual shape of the earth but rather is a mathematical model of its shape despite these issues in 1793 france adopted this definition of the metre as its official unit of length based on provisional results from this expedition
=== prototype metre baredit ===
in the 1870s and in light of modern precision a series of international conferences was held to devise new metric standards the metre convention (convention du mtre) of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent international bureau of weights and measures (bipm bureau international des poids et mesures) to be located in svres france this new organisation was to construct and preserve a prototype metre bar distribute national metric prototypes and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards the organisation created such a bar in 1889 at the first general conference on weights and measures (cgpm confrence gnrale des poids et mesures) establishing the international prototype metre as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium measured at the melting point of ice
however it was later determined that the first prototype metre bar was short by about 200 micrometres because of miscalculation of the flattening of the earth making the prototype about 0.02% shorter than the original proposed definition of the metre regardless this length became the standard the original international prototype of the metre is still kept at the bipm under the conditions specified in 1889
=== number of wavelengths of red-orange emission line of krypton-86edit ===
in 1893 the standard metre was first measured with an interferometer by albert a michelson the inventor of the device and an advocate of using some particular wavelength of light as a standard of length by 1925 interferometry was in regular use at the bipm however the international prototype metre remained the standard until 1960 when the eleventh cgpm defined the metre in the new international system of units (si) as equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum
=== distance travelled by light in a specified timeedit ===
to further reduce uncertainty the 17th cgpm in 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of the second and the speed of light
the metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/7008299792458000000299792458 of a second
this definition fixed the speed of light in vacuum at exactly 7008299792458000000299792458 metres per second (300 000 km/s) an intended by-product of the 17th cgpm's definition was that it enabled scientists to compare lasers accurately using frequency resulting in wavelengths with one-fifth the uncertainty involved in the direct comparison of wavelengths because interferometer errors were eliminated to further facilitate reproducibility from lab to lab the 17th cgpm also made the iodine-stabilised heliumneon laser a recommended radiation for realising the metre for the purpose of delineating the metre the bipm currently considers the hene laser wavelength hene to be 7002632991212580000632.99121258 nm with an estimated relative standard uncertainty (u) of 69892100000000000002.11011 this uncertainty is currently one limiting factor in laboratory realisations of the metre and it is several orders of magnitude poorer than that of the second based upon the caesium fountain atomic clock (u = 698450000000000000051016) consequently a realisation of the metre is usually delineated (not defined) today in labs as 70061579800762042001579800.762042(33) wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in a vacuum the error stated being only that of frequency determination this bracket notation expressing the error is explained in the article on measurement uncertainty
practical realisation of the metre is subject to uncertainties in characterising the medium to various uncertainties of interferometry and to uncertainties in measuring the frequency of the source a commonly used medium is air and the national institute of standards and technology (nist) has set up an online calculator to convert wavelengths in vacuum to wavelengths in air as described by nist in air the uncertainties in characterising the medium are dominated by errors in measuring temperature and pressure errors in the theoretical formulas used are secondary by implementing a refractive index correction such as this an approximate realisation of the metre can be implemented in air for example using the formulation of the metre as 70061579800762042001579800.762042(33) wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in vacuum and converting the wavelengths in a vacuum to wavelengths in air of course air is only one possible medium to use in a realisation of the metre and any partial vacuum can be used or some inert atmosphere like helium gas provided the appropriate corrections for refractive index are implemented
the metre is defined as the path length travelled by light in a given time and practical laboratory length measurements in metres are determined by counting the number of wavelengths of laser light of one of the standard types that fit into the length and converting the selected unit of wavelength to metres three major factors limit the accuracy attainable with laser interferometers for a length measurement
uncertainty in vacuum wavelength of the source
uncertainty in the refractive index of the medium
least count resolution of the interferometer
of these the last is peculiar to the interferometer itself the conversion of a length in wavelengths to a length in metres is based upon the relation
which converts the unit of wavelength to metres using c the speed of light in a vacuum in m/s here n is the refractive index of the medium in which the measurement is made and f is the measured frequency of the source although conversion from wavelengths to metres introduces an additional error in the overall length due to measurement error in determining the refractive index and the frequency the measurement of frequency is one of the most accurate measurements available
=== timelineedit ===
8 may 1790 the french national assembly decides that the length of the new metre would be equal to the length of a pendulum with a half-period of one second
30 march 1791 the french national assembly accepts the proposal by the french academy of sciences that the new definition for the metre be equal to one ten-millionth of the length of a quadrant along the earth's meridian through paris that is the distance from the equator to the north pole
1795 provisional metre bar constructed of brass based on bessel's ellipsoid and legally equal to 443.44 lines on the toise du prou (a standard french unit of length from 1747)
10 december 1799 the french national assembly specifies the platinum metre bar constructed on 23 june 1799 and deposited in the national archives as the final standard legally equal to 443.296 lines on the toise du prou
28 september 1889 the 1st general conference on weights and measures (cgpm) defines the metre as the distance between two lines on a standard bar of an alloy of platinum with 10% iridium measured at the melting point of ice
6 october 1927 the 7th cgpm redefines the metre as the distance at 0 c (273 k) between the axes of the two central lines marked on the prototype bar of platinum-iridium this bar being subject to one standard atmosphere of pressure and supported on two cylinders of at least 10 mm (1 cm) diameter symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571 mm (57.1 cm) from each other
14 october 1960 the 11th cgpm defines the metre as 70061650763730000001650763.73 wavelengths in a vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the 2p10 and 5d5 quantum levels of the krypton-86 atom
21 october 1983 the 17th cgpm defines the metre as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second
2002 the international committee for weights and measures (cipm) considers the metre to be a unit of proper length and thus recommends this definition be restricted to lengths which are sufficiently short for the effects predicted by general relativity to be negligible with respect to the uncertainties of realisation
== si prefixed forms of metreedit ==
si prefixes are often employed to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of the metre as shown in the table below as indicated in the table some are commonly used while others are not long distances are usually expressed in km astronomical units (149.6 gm) light-years (10 pm) or parsecs (31 pm) rather than in mm gm tm pm em zm or ym 30 cm 30 m and 300 m are more common than 3 dm 3 dam and 3 hm respectively
the terms micron and (occasionally) millimicron are often used instead of micrometre (m) and nanometre (nm) but this practice is officially discouraged
== equivalents in other unitsedit ==
within this table inch and yard mean international inch and international yard respectively though approximate conversions in the left-hand column hold for both international and survey units
 means is approximately equal to
 means equal by definition or is exactly equal to.
one metre is exactly equivalent to 10 000/254 inches and to 10 000/9 144 yards
a simple mnemonic aid exists to assist with conversion as three 3"s
1 metre is nearly equivalent to 3 feet 3 38 inches this gives an overestimate of 0.125 mm however the practice of memorising such conversion formulas has been discouraged in favour of practice and visualisation of metric units
the ancient egyptian cubit was about 0.5 m (surviving rods are 523529 mm) scottish and english definitions of the ell (two cubits) were 941 mm (0.941 m) and 1 143 mm (1.143 m) respectively the ancient parisian toise (fathom) was slightly shorter than 2 m and was standardised at exactly 2 m in the mesures usuelles system such that 1 m was exactly 12 toise the russian versta was 1.0668 km the swedish mil was 10.688 km but was changed to 10 km when sweden converted to metric units
