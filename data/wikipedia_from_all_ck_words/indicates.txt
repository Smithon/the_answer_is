home to the ancient indus valley civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires the indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history four religionshinduism buddhism jainism and sikhismoriginated here whereas zoroastrianism and the abrahamic religions of judaism christianity and islam arrived in the first millennium ce and also shaped the region's diverse culture gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the british east india company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the united kingdom after the indian rebellion of 1857 india became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by mahatma gandhi
the indian economy is the world's seventh-largest by nominal gdp and third-largest by purchasing power parity (ppp) following market-based economic reforms in 1991 india became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country as a nuclear weapons state and regional power it has the third-largest standing army in the world and ranks ninth in military expenditure among nations however it continues to face the challenges of poverty corruption malnutrition inadequate public health and terrorism
== etymology ==
the name india is derived from indus which originates from the old persian word hindu the latter term stems from the sanskrit word sindhu which was the historical local appellation for the indus river the ancient greeks referred to the indians as indoi () which translates as the people of the indus
the geographical term bharat (bhrat pronounced [bart]) which is recognised by the constitution of india as an official name for the country is used by many indian languages in its variations it is a modernisation of the historical name bharatavarsha which gained increasing currency from the mid-19th century onwards as a native name of india scholars believe it to be named after the vedic tribe of bharatas in punjab in the second millennium b.c.e however traditionally it is associated with the rule of the legendary emperor bharata gaarjya (literally people's state) is the sanskrit/hindi term for republic dating back to the ancient times
hindustan ([ndstan]) is an ancient persian name for india dating to 3 century b.c.e it was introduced into india by the mughals and widely used since then often being thought of as the land of the hindus. its meaning varied referring to a region that encompassed northern india and pakistan or india in its entirety
== history ==
the earliest authenticated human remains in south asia date to about 30,000 years ago nearly contemporaneous mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the indian subcontinent including at the bhimbetka rock shelters in madhya pradesh around 7000 bce the first known neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in mehrgarh and other sites in western pakistan these gradually developed into the indus valley civilisation the first urban culture in south asia it flourished during 25001900 bce in pakistan and western india along the river valleys of indus and sarasvati centred on cities such as mohenjo-daro harappa rakhigarhi dholavira and kalibangan and relying on varied forms of subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade
during the period 2000500 bce in terms of culture many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic to the iron age the vedas the oldest scriptures of hinduism were composed during this period and historians have analysed these to posit a vedic culture in the punjab region and the upper gangetic plain most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of indo-aryan migration into the subcontinent the caste system arose during this period which created a hierarchy of priests warriors free peasants and traders and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical state-level polities on the deccan plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation in southern india a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions
in the late vedic period around the 6th century bce the small states and chiefdoms of the ganges plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas the emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created heterodox religious movements two of which became independent religions buddhism based on the teachings of gautama buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in india jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar mahavira in an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal and both established long-lasting monastic traditions politically by the 3rd century bce the kingdom of magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the mauryan empire the empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas the mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the buddhist dhamma
the sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that between 200 bce and 200 ce the southern peninsula was being ruled by the cheras the cholas and the pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and south-east asia in north india hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women by the 4th and 5th centuries the gupta empire had created in the greater ganges plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later indian kingdoms under the guptas a renewed hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself the renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite classical sanskrit literature flowered as well and indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances
=== medieval india ===
the indian early medieval age 600 ce to 1200 ce is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity when harsha of kannauj who ruled much of the indo-gangetic plain from 606 to 647 ce attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the chalukya ruler of the deccan when his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the pala king of bengal when the chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the pandyas and the cholas from still farther south no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region during this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes the caste system consequently began to show regional differences
in the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the tamil language they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another urbanisation by the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in south-east asia as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam philippines malaysia and java indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission south-east asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their languages
after the 10th century muslim central asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran south asia's north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in 1206 the sultanate was to control much of north india and to make many forays into south india although at first disruptive for the indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-muslim subject population to its own laws and customs by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic indo-islamic culture in the north the sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara empire embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular india and was to influence south indian society for long afterwards
=== early modern india ===
in the early 16th century northern india being then under mainly muslim rulers fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian warriors the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity especially under akbar the mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status the mughal state's economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in india's economic expansion resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture newly coherent social groups in northern and western india such as the marathas the rajputs and the sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern india as the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs the single most important power that emerged in the early modern period was the maratha confederacy
by the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of european trading companies including the english east india company had established coastal outposts the east india company's control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite both these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other european companies its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of india by the 1820s india was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the british empire with raw materials and many historians consider this to be the onset of india's colonial period by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and itself effectively made an arm of british administration the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education social reform and culture
=== modern india ===
historians consider india's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 the appointment in 1848 of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state these included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens technological changesamong them railways canals and the telegraphwere introduced not long after their introduction in europe however disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the indian rebellion of 1857 fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive british-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company rule although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the east india company and to the direct administration of india by the british government proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited british-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest in the decades following public life gradually emerged all over india leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in 1885
the rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacksmany small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets there was an increase in the number of large-scale famines and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for indians there were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption the railway network provided critical famine relief notably reduced the cost of moving goods and helped nascent indian-owned industry after world war i in which approximately one million indians served a new period began it was marked by british reforms but also repressive legislations by more strident indian calls for self-rule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-cooperation of which mohandas karamchand gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol during the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the british the indian national congress won victories in the resulting elections the next decade was beset with crises indian participation in world war ii the congress's final push for non-cooperation and an upsurge of muslim nationalism all were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of india into two states india and pakistan
vital to india's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution completed in 1950 which put in place a secular and democratic republic upon indian independence in 1947 george vi ceased to be the emperor of india a title rescinded retroactively by an act of parliament on 22 june 1948 and became king of india until 26 january 1950 in the 60 years since india has had a mixed record of successes and failures it has remained a democracy with civil liberties an active supreme court and a largely independent press economic liberalisation which was begun in the 1990s has created a large urban middle class transformed india into one of the world's fastest-growing economies and increased its geopolitical clout indian movies music and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture yet india is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty both rural and urban by religious and caste-related violence by maoist-inspired naxalite insurgencies and by separatism in jammu and kashmir and in northeast india it has unresolved territorial disputes with china and with pakistan the indiapakistan nuclear rivalry came to a head in 1998 india's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's new nations however in spite of its recent economic successes freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved
== geography ==
india comprises the bulk of the indian subcontinent lying atop the indian tectonic plate and part of the indo-australian plate india's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the indian plate then part of the southern supercontinent gondwana began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west and later south and south-east simultaneously the vast tethyn oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the eurasian plate these dual processes driven by convection in the earth's mantle both created the indian ocean and caused the indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust eurasia and to uplift the himalayas immediately south of the emerging himalayas plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the indo-gangetic plain cut off from the plain by the ancient aravalli range lies the thar desert
the original indian plate survives as peninsular india the oldest and geologically most stable part of india it extends as far north as the satpura and vindhya ranges in central india these parallel chains run from the arabian sea coast in gujarat in the west to the coal-rich chota nagpur plateau in jharkhand in the east to the south the remaining peninsular landmass the deccan plateau is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the western and eastern ghats the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations some over one billion years old constituted in such fashion india lies to the north of the equator between 6 44 and 35 30 north latitude and 68 7 and 97 25 east longitude
india's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length of this distance 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular india and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the andaman nicobar and lakshadweep island chains according to the indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following 43% sandy beaches 11% rocky shores including cliffs and 46% mudflats or marshy shores
major himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drain into the bay of bengal important tributaries of the ganges include the yamuna and the kosi the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drain into the bay of bengal and the narmada and the tapti which drain into the arabian sea coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india the latter is shared with bangladesh india has two archipelagos the lakshadweep coral atolls off india's south-western coast and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea
the indian climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons the himalayas prevent cold central asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes the thar desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that between june and october provide the majority of india's rainfall four major climatic groupings predominate in india tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane
== biodiversity ==
india lies within the indomalaya ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots one of 17 megadiverse countries it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian 13.7% of all avian 7.9% of all reptilian 6% of all amphibian 12.2% of all piscine and 6.0% of all flowering plant species about 21.2% of the country's landmass is covered by forests (tree canopy density >10%) of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%) endemism is high among plants 33% and among ecoregions such as the shola forests habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the andaman islands western ghats and north-east india to the coniferous forest of the himalaya between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern india the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern india and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central deccan and western gangetic plain the medicinal neem widely used in rural indian herbal remedies is a key indian tree the luxuriant pipal fig tree shown on the seals of mohenjo-daro shaded gautama buddha as he sought enlightenment
many indian species descend from taxa originating in gondwana from which the indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present peninsular india's subsequent movement towards and collision with the laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction mammals then entered india from asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising himalaya thus while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians are endemic only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are among them are the nilgiri leaf monkey and beddome's toad of the western ghats india contains 172 iucn-designated threatened animal species or 2.9% of endangered forms these include the asiatic lion the bengal tiger the snow leopard and the indian white-rumped vulture which by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle nearly went extinct
the pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered indian wildlife in response the system of national parks and protected areas first established in 1935 was substantially expanded in 1972 india enacted the wildlife protection act and project tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness the forest conservation act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988 india hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves four of which are part of the world network of biosphere reserves twenty-five wetlands are registered under the ramsar convention
== politics ==
india is the world's most populous democracy a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system it has six recognised national parties including the indian national congress and the bharatiya janata party (bjp) and more than 40 regional parties the congress is considered centre-left in indian political culture and the bjp right-wing for most of the period between 1950when india first became a republicand the late 1980s the congress held a majority in the parliament since then however it has increasingly shared the political stage with the bjp as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre
in the republic of india's first three general elections in 1951 1957 and 1962 the jawaharlal nehru-led congress won easy victories on nehru's death in 1964 lal bahadur shastri briefly became prime minister he was succeeded after his own unexpected death in 1966 by indira gandhi who went on to lead the congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971 following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975 the congress was voted out of power in 1977 the then-new janata party which had opposed the emergency was voted in its government lasted just over three years voted back into power in 1980 the congress saw a change in leadership in 1984 when indira gandhi was assassinated she was succeeded by her son rajiv gandhi who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year the congress was voted out again in 1989 when a national front coalition led by the newly formed janata dal in alliance with the left front won the elections that government too proved relatively short-lived lasting just under two years elections were held again in 1991 no party won an absolute majority but the congress as the largest single party was able to form a minority government led by p v narasimha rao
a two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996 several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre the bjp formed a government briefly in 1996 it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting united front coalitions which depended on external support in 1998 the bjp was able to form a successful coalition the national democratic alliance (nda) led by atal bihari vajpayee the nda became the first non-congress coalition government to complete a five-year term in the 2004 indian general elections again no party won an absolute majority but the congress emerged as the largest single party forming another successful coalition the united progressive alliance (upa) it had the support of left-leaning parties and mps who opposed the bjp the upa returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers and it no longer required external support from india's communist parties that year manmohan singh became the first prime minister since jawaharlal nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term in the 2014 general election the bjp became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties the prime minister of india is narendra modi who was also the former chief minister of gujarat

== foreign relations and military ==
since its independence in 1947 india has maintained cordial relations with most nations in the 1950s it strongly supported decolonisation in africa and asia and played a lead role in the non-aligned movement in the late 1980s the indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of neighbouring countries a peace-keeping operation in sri lanka between 1987 and 1990 and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'tat attempt in maldives india has tense relations with neighbouring pakistan the two nations have gone to war four times in 1947 1965 1971 and 1999 three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of kashmir while the fourth the 1971 war followed from india's support for the independence of bangladesh after waging the 1962 sino-indian war and the 1965 war with pakistan india pursued close military and economic ties with the soviet union by the late 1960s the soviet union was its largest arms supplier
aside from ongoing strategic relations with russia india has wide-ranging defence relations with israel and france in recent years it has played key roles in the south asian association for regional cooperation and the world trade organisation the nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 un peacekeeping operations across four continents it participates in the east asia summit the g8+5 and other multilateral forums india has close economic ties with south america asia and africa it pursues a look east policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the asean nations japan and south korea that revolve around many issues but especially those involving economic investment and regional security
china's nuclear test of 1964 as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of pakistan in the 1965 war convinced india to develop nuclear weapons india conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998 despite criticism and military sanctions india has signed neither the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty nor the nuclear non-proliferation treaty considering both to be flawed and discriminatory india maintains a no first use nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its minimum credible deterrence doctrine it is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and in collaboration with russia a fifth-generation fighter jet other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of vikrant-class aircraft carriers and arihant-class nuclear submarines
since the end of the cold war india has increased its economic strategic and military cooperation with the united states and the european union in 2008 a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between india and the united states although india possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty it received waivers from the international atomic energy agency and the nuclear suppliers group ending earlier restrictions on india's nuclear technology and commerce as a consequence india became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state india subsequently signed cooperation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with russia france the united kingdom and canada

according to the international monetary fund (imf) as of october 2015 the indian economy is nominally worth us$2.182 trillion it is the 7th-largest economy by market exchange rates and is at us$8.027 trillion the third-largest by purchasing power parity or ppp with its average annual gdp growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades and reaching 6.1% during 201112 india is one of the world's fastest-growing economies however the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal gdp per capita and 129th in gdp per capita at ppp until 1991 all indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows india's recent economic model is largely capitalist india has been a member of wto since 1 january 1995
the 486.6-million worker indian labour force is the world's second-largest as of 2011 the service sector makes up 55.6% of gdp the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1% major agricultural products include rice wheat oilseed cotton jute tea sugarcane and potatoes major industries include textiles telecommunications chemicals pharmaceuticals biotechnology food processing steel transport equipment cement mining petroleum machinery and software in 2006 the share of external trade in india's gdp stood at 24% up from 6% in 1985 in 2008 india's share of world trade was 1.68% in 2011 india was the world's tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter major exports include petroleum products textile goods jewellery software engineering goods chemicals and leather manufactures major imports include crude oil machinery gems fertiliser and chemicals between 2001 and 2011 the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42% india was the second largest textile exporter after china in the world in calendar year 2013
averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007 india has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century some 431 million indians have left poverty since 1985 india's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030 though ranking 51st in global competitiveness india ranks 17th in financial market sophistication 24th in the banking sector 44th in business sophistication and 39th in innovation ahead of several advanced economies as of 2010 with 7 of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in india the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the united states as of 2009 india's consumer market the world's eleventh-largest is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030
driven by growth india's nominal gdp per capita has steadily increased from us$329 in 1991 when economic liberalisation began to us$1,265 in 2010 and is estimated to increase to us$2,110 by 2016 however it has remained lower than those of other asian developing countries such as indonesia malaysia philippines sri lanka and thailand and is expected to remain so in the near future however it is higher than pakistan nepal afghanistan bangladesh and others
according to a 2011 pricewaterhousecoopers report india's gdp at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the united states by 2045 during the next four decades indian gdp is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8% making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050 the report highlights key growth factors a young and rapidly growing working-age population growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class the world bank cautions that for india to achieve its economic potential it must continue to focus on public sector reform transport infrastructure agricultural and rural development removal of labour regulations education energy security and public health and nutrition
