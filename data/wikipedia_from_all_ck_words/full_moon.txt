a full moon is the lunar phase that occurs when the moon is completely illuminated as seen from the earth this occurs when the moon is in opposition to the sun (when it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun more precisely when the ecliptic longitudes of the sun and moon differ by 180 degrees) this means that the hemisphere of the moon that is facing the earth (the near side) is almost fully illuminated by the sun and appears round (while the far side is almost completely unilluminated)
lunar eclipses can occur only at full moon where the moon's orbit allows it to pass through the earth's shadow lunar eclipses do not occur every month because the moon usually passes above or below the earth's shadow (which is mostly restricted to the ecliptic plane) lunar eclipses can occur only when the full moon occurs near the two nodes of the orbit either the ascending or descending node this causes eclipses to only occur about every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a solar eclipse at new moon at the opposite node
the time interval between similar lunar phasesthe synodic monthaverages about 29.53 days therefore in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the new moon the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th of the lunar month because calendar months have a whole number of days lunar months may be either 29 or 30 days long
== characteristics ==
a full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration this is somewhat misleading because the moon seen from earth is continuously becoming larger or smaller (though much too slowly to notice with the naked eye) its absolute maximum size occurs at the moment expansion has stopped for any given location about half of these absolute maximum full moons will be potentially visible as the other half occur during the day when the full moon is below the horizon many almanacs list full moons not just by date but by their exact time as well usually in coordinated universal time (utc) typical monthly calendars that include phases of the moon may be off by one day if intended for use in a different time zone
full moons are generally a poor time to conduct astronomical observations since the bright reflected sunlight from the moon overwhelms the dimmer light from stars
on 12 december 2008 the full moon occurred closer to the earth than it had at any time for the previous 15 years
on 19 march 2011 another super full moon occurred closer to the earth than it had at any time for the previous ~18 years (cycle)
=== formula ===
the date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation
where d is the number of days since 1 january 2000 00:00:00 in the terrestrial time scale used in astronomical ephemerides for universal time (ut) add the following approximate correction to d
days
where n is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000 the true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon's orbit see new moon for an explanation of the formula and its parameters
the age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months which has been referred to as a full moon cycle
== in folklore and tradition ==
full moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia (inability to sleep) insanity (hence the terms lunacy and lunatic) and various magical phenomena such as lycanthropy psychologists however have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon they find that studies are generally not consistent with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect in one instance the 23 december 2000 issue of the british medical journal published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in england and australia the study of the bradford royal infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in australia found that they were less likely all this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior
=== full moon names ===
historically month names are names of moons (lunations not necessarily full moons) in lunisolar calendars since the introduction of the solar julian calendar in the roman empire and later the gregorian calendar worldwide month names have ceased to be perceived as moon names the traditional old english month names were equated with the names of the julian calendar from an early time (soon after christianization according to the testimony of bede ca ad 700)
some full moons have developed new names in modern times e.g. the blue moon and the names harvest moon and hunter's moon for the full moons of autumn
==== harvest and hunter's moons ====
the harvest moon and hunter's moon are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the autumn in the northern hemisphere usually in august september and october respectively the harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox (22 or 23 september) and the hunter's moon is the one following it the names are recorded from the early 18th century oed for harvest moon cites a 1706 reference and for hunter's moon a 1710 edition of the british apollo where the term is attributed to the country people (the country people call this the hunters-moon.) the names became traditional in american folklore where they are now often popularly attributed to the native americans the feast of the hunters moon is a yearly festival in west lafayette indiana held in late september or early october each year since 1968 in 2010 the harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself (some 512 hours after the point of equinox) for the first time since 1991
all full moons rise around the time of sunset because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed causing it to rise later each day on average by about 50.47 minutes the harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average the moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next as seen from about 40 degrees n or s latitude thus there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days following the actual date of the full moon
==== farmers almanacs ====
the maine farmers almanac from c the 1930s began to publish native american indian full moon names the farmers almanac (since 1955 published in maine but not the same publication as the maine farmers almanac) continues to do so
an early list of indian month names was published in 1918 by daniel carter beard in his the american boy's book of signs signals and symbols for use by the boy scouts beard's indian month names were
january difficulty black smoke
february racoon bare spots on the ground
march wind little grass sore-eye
april ducks goose-eggs
may green grass root-food
june corn-planting strawberry
july buffalo (bull) hot sun
august harvest cow buffalo
september wild rice red plum
october leaf-falling nuts
november deer-mating fur-pelts
december wolves big moon
such names have gained currency in american folklore they appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the moon mysteries of the moon by patricia haddock ("great mysteries series greenhaven press 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with haddock supposes that certain colonial american moon names were adopted from algonquian languages (which were formerly spoken in the territory of new england) while others are based in european tradition (e.g. the colonial american names for the may moon milk moon mother's moon hare moon have no parallels in the supposed native names while the name of november beaver moon is supposedly based in the algonquin)
the individual names given in farmers almanac include
january wolf moon (this is the name of december in beard 1918) also old moon
february snow moon also hunger moon
march worm moon crow moon sap moon lenten moon
april seed moon pink moon sprouting grass moon egg moon (c.f goose-egg in beard 1918) fish moon
may milk moon flower moon corn planting moon
june mead moon strawberry moon (c.f beard 1918) rose moon thunder moon
july hay moon buck moon thunder moon
august corn moon sturgeon moon red moon green corn moon grain moon
september harvest moon full corn moon
october hunter's moon blood moon"/"sanguine moon
november beaver moon frosty moon
december oak moon cold moon long nights moon

== lunar and lunisolar calendars ==
most pre-modern calendars the world over were lunisolar combining the solar year with the lunation by means of intercalary months the julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century islamic calendar opted for a purely lunar one
a continuing lunisolar calendar is in the hebrew calendar evidence of this is noted in the dates of passover and easter in judaism and christianity respectively the date of the jewish rosh hashana and sukkot festivals along with all other jewish holidays are dependent on the dates of the new moons
=== intercalary months ===
in lunisolar calendars an intercalary month occurs 7 times in the 19 years of the metonic cycle or on average every 2.7 years (19/7) in the hebrew calendar this is noted with a periodic extra month of adar in the early spring
in the modern system of traditional full moon names tied to the solstice and equinox points a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon the term blue moon used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century but it became well known in the united states due to the farmers almanac (published since 1818)
according to the farmers almanac a blue moon is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox or between equinox and solstice (calculated using the mean tropical year) which contains four full moons these seasons are equal in length unlike the astronomical ones which vary in length depending on the earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun to compare in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 am on 23 march 9.15 am on 22 june 4.42 pm on 21 september and 12.10 am on 22 december while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 am on 21 march 11.09 pm on 21 june 2.42 pm on 23 september and 10.30 am on 22 december (all times gmt) due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the march 1946 sky & telescope magazine blue moon has also been used in the sense of the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as erroneous by sky & telescope in 1999) according to either definition blue moons occur with the average frequency of intercalary months seven times in 19 years the farmers almanac system of full moon names effectively defining a lunisolar calendar
