messenger rna (mrna) is a large family of rna molecules that convey genetic information from dna to the ribosome where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression following transcription of primary transcript mrna (known as pre-mrna) by rna polymerase processed mature mrna is translated into a polymer of amino acids a protein as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology
as in dna mrna genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides which are arranged into codons consisting of three bases each each codon encodes for a specific amino acid except the stop codons which terminate protein synthesis this process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of rna transfer rna (trna) that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid and ribosomal rna (rrna) that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery
the existence of mrna was first suggested by jacques monod and franois jacob and subsequently discovered by jacob sydney brenner and matthew meselson at the california institute of technology in 1961
it should not be confused with mitochondrial dna
== synthesis processing and functionedit ==
the brief existence of an mrna molecule begins with transcription and ultimately ends in degradation during its life an mrna molecule may also be processed edited and transported prior to translation eukaryotic mrna molecules often require extensive processing and transport while prokaryotic molecules do not
=== transcriptionedit ===
transcription is when rna is made from dna during transcription rna polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the dna to mrna as needed this process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes one notable difference however is that eukaryotic rna polymerase associates with mrna-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription the short-lived unprocessed or partially processed product is termed precursor mrna or pre-mrna once completely processed it is termed mature mrna
=== eukaryotic pre-mrna processingedit ===
processing of mrna differs greatly among eukaryotes bacteria and archea non-eukaryotic mrna is in essence mature upon transcription and requires no processing except in rare cases eukaryotic pre-mrna however requires extensive processing
==== 5 cap additionedit ====
a 5 cap (also termed an rna cap an rna 7-methylguanosine cap or an rna m7g cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the front or 5 end of a eukaryotic messenger rna shortly after the start of transcription the 5 cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from rnases
cap addition is coupled to transcription and occurs co-transcriptionally such that each influences the other shortly after the start of transcription the 5 end of the mrna being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with rna polymerase this enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mrna capping synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction
==== editingedit ====
in some instances an mrna will be edited changing the nucleotide composition of that mrna an example in humans is the apolipoprotein b mrna which is edited in some tissues but not others the editing creates an early stop codon which upon translation produces a shorter protein
==== polyadenylationedit ====
polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger rna molecule in eukaryotic organisms most messenger rna (mrna) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3 end but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common the poly(a) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mrna from degradation by exonucleases polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination export of the mrna from the nucleus and translation mrna can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms where poly(a) tails act to facilitate rather than impede exonucleolytic degradation
polyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of dna into rna after transcription has been terminated the mrna chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with rna polymerase after the mrna has been cleaved around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3 end at the cleavage site this reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase just as in alternative splicing there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mrna
polyadenylation site mutations also occur the primary rna transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-a addition site and 100-200 as are added to the 3 end of the rna if this site is altered an abnormally long and unstable mrna construct will be formed
=== transportedit ===
another difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mrna transport because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated eukaryotic mrnas must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasma process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways mature mrnas are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins cbp20 and cbp80 as well as the transcription/export complex (trex) multiple mrna export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes
in neurons mrna must be transported from the soma to the dendrites where local translation occurs in response to external stimuli such as -actin mrna upon export from the nucleus the mrna associates with zbp1 and the 40s subunit the complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton eventually zbp1 is phosphorylated by src in order for translation to be initiated many messages are marked with so-called zip codes, which target their transport to a specific location
=== translationedit ===
because prokaryotic mrna does not need to be processed or transported translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription therefore it can be said that prokaryotic translation is coupled to transcription and occurs co-transcriptionally
eukaryotic mrna that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e. mature mrna) can then be translated by the ribosome translation may occur at ribosomes free-floating in the cytoplasm or directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle therefore unlike in prokaryotes eukaryotic translation is not directly coupled to transcription
== structureedit ==
=== coding regionsedit ===
coding regions are composed of codons which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon in general the start codon is an aug triplet and the stop codon is uaa uag or uga the coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs this impedes degradation in addition to being protein-coding portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mrna as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers
=== untranslated regionsedit ===
untranslated regions (utrs) are sections of the mrna before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated termed the five prime untranslated region (5 utr) and three prime untranslated region (3 utr) respectively these regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are exonic as they are present in the mature mrna several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions including mrna stability mrna localization and translational efficiency the ability of a utr to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the utr and can differ between mrnas genetic variants in 3 utr have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in rna structure and protein translation
the stability of mrnas may be controlled by the 5 utr and/or 3 utr due to varying affinity for rna degrading enzymes called ribonucleases and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit rna degradation (see also c-rich stability element.)
translational efficiency including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation can be controlled by utrs proteins that bind to either the 3 or 5 utr may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mrna micrornas bound to the 3 utr also may affect translational efficiency or mrna stability
cytoplasmic localization of mrna is thought to be a function of the 3 utr proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there in such a case the 3 utr may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation
some of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribed into rna these structural mrna elements are involved in regulating the mrna some such as the secis element are targets for proteins to bind one class of mrna element the riboswitches directly bind small molecules changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation in these cases the mrna regulates itself
=== poly(a) tailedit ===
the 3 poly(a) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3 end of the pre-mrna this tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation and protects the mrna from degradation
=== monocistronic versus polycistronic mrnaedit ===
an mrna molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide) this is the case for most of the eukaryotic mrnas on the other hand polycistronic mrna carries several open reading frames (orfs) each of which is translated into a polypeptide these polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region containing a promoter and an operator most of the mrna found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic as is the human mitochondrial genome  dicistronic or bicistronic mrna encodes only two proteins
=== mrna circularizationedit ===
in eukaryotes mrna molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the eif4e and poly(a)-binding protein which both bind to eif4g forming an mrna-protein-mrna bridge circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mrna leading to time-efficient translation and may also function to ensure only intact mrna are translated (partially degraded mrna characteristically have no m7g cap or no poly-a tail)
other mechanisms for circularization exist particularly in virus mrna poliovirus mrna uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5 end to bind pcbp2 which binds poly(a)-binding protein forming the familiar mrna-protein-mrna circle barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mrna segments on its 5 end and 3 end (called kissing stem loops) circularizing the mrna without any proteins involved
rna virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mrna) are also commonly circularized during genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds cycling viral rna-dependent rna polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle
== degradationedit ==
different mrnas within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities) in bacterial cells individual mrnas can survive from seconds to more than an hour in mammalian cells mrna lifetimes range from several minutes to days the greater the stability of an mrna the more protein may be produced from that mrna the limited lifetime of mrna enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs there are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mrna some of which are described below
=== prokaryotic mrna degradationedit ===
in general in prokaryotes the lifetime of mrna is much shorter than in eukaryotes prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases including endonucleases 3 exonucleases and 5 exonucleases in some instances small rna molecules (srna) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mrnas by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by rnase iii it was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of 5 cap consisting of a triphosphate on the 5 end removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5 monophosphate causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease rnase j which degrades 5 to 3
=== eukaryotic mrna turnoveredit ===
inside eukaryotic cells there is a balance between the processes of translation and mrna decay messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes the eukaryotic initiation factors eif-4e and eif-4g and poly(a)-binding protein eif-4e and eif-4g block the decapping enzyme (dcp2) and poly(a)-binding protein blocks the exosome complex protecting the ends of the message the balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as p-bodies the poly(a) tail of the mrna is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger rnas by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the rna and trans-acting rna-binding proteins poly(a) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex the message is then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex in this way translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly while active messages remain intact the mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail
=== au-rich element decayedit ===
the presence of au-rich elements in some mammalian mrnas tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate poly(a) tail removal loss of the poly(a) tail is thought to promote mrna degradation by facilitating attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex rapid mrna degradation via au-rich elements is a critical mechanism for preventing the overproduction of potent cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) au-rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto-oncogenic transcription factors like c-jun and c-fos
=== nonsense mediated decayedit ===
eukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by nonsense mediated decay (nmd) which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message these can arise via incomplete splicing v(d)j recombination in the adaptive immune system mutations in dna transcription errors leaky scanning by the ribosome causing a frame shift and other causes detection of a premature stop codon triggers mrna degradation by 5 decapping 3 poly(a) tail removal or endonucleolytic cleavage
=== small interfering rna (sirna)edit ===
in metazoans small interfering rnas (sirnas) processed by dicer are incorporated into a complex known as the rna-induced silencing complex or risc this complex contains an endonuclease that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the sirna binds the resulting mrna fragments are then destroyed by exonucleases sirna is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture it is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded rna viruses
=== microrna (mirna)edit ===
micrornas (mirnas) are small rnas that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger rnas binding of a mirna to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(a) tail removal thereby hastening mrna degradation the mechanism of action of mirnas is the subject of active research
=== other decay mechanismsedit ===
there are other ways by which messages can be degraded including non-stop decay and silencing by piwi-interacting rna (pirna) among others
