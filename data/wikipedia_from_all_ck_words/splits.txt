sport (uk) or sports (us) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing entertainment to participants and in some cases spectators usually the contest or game is between two sides each attempting to exceed the other some sports allow a tie game others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser a number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season followed in some cases by playoffs hundreds of sports exist from those between single contestants through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants either in teams or competing as individuals in certain sports such as racing many contestants may compete each against all with one winner
sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity with the largest major competitions such as the olympic games admitting only sports meeting this definition and other organisations such as the council of europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports however a number of competitive but non-physical activities claim recognition as mind sports the international olympic committee (through arisf) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports and sportaccord the international sports federation association recognises five non-physical sports although limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports
sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs which serve to ensure fair competition and allow consistent adjudication of the winner winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first it can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression
records of performance are often kept and for popular sports this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting sports betting is in some cases severely regulated and in some cases is central to the sport
according to a.t kearney a consultancy the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013 the world's most accessible and practised sport is running while association football is its most popular spectator sport
== meaning and usageedit ==
=== etymologyedit ===
sport comes from the old french desport meaning leisure with the oldest definition in english from around 1300 being anything humans find amusing or entertaining
other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling hunting and games and diversions including ones that require exercise roget's defines the noun sport as an activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement with synonyms including diversion and recreation
=== nomenclatureedit ===
the singular term sport is used in most english dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g children taking part in sport") with sports used to describe multiple activities (e.g football and rugby are the most popular sports in england") american english uses sports for both terms
=== definitionedit ===
the precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources the closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by sportaccord which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football athletics cycling tennis equestrian sports and more) and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport
sportaccord uses the following criteria determining that a sport should
have an element of competition
be in no way harmful to any living creature
not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)
not rely on any luck element specifically designed into the sport
they also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics) primarily mind (such as chess or go) predominantly motorised (such as formula 1 or powerboating) primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports) or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport)
the inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports whilst sportaccord recognises a small number of mind sports it is not open to admitting any further mind sports
there has been an increase in the application of the term sport to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games also called esports especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations
=== competitionedit ===
there are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport with almost all professional sport involving competition and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the international olympic committee(ioc) or sportaccord
other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity for instance the council of europe include all forms of physical exercise including those completed just for fun
in order to widen participation and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days although moves like this are often controversial
in competitive events participants are graded or classified based on their result and often divided into groups of comparable performance (e.g gender weight and age) the measurement of the result may be objective or subjective and corrected with handicaps or penalties in a race for example the time to complete the course is an objective measurement in gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges and therefore subjective there are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time
== historyedit ==
artifacts and structures suggest sport in china as early as 2000 bc gymnastics appears to have been popular in china's ancient past monuments to the pharaohs indicate that a number of sports including swimming and fishing were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient egypt other egyptian sports included javelin throwing high jump and wrestling ancient persian sports such as the traditional iranian martial art of zourkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills among other sports that originate in ancient persia are polo and jousting

=== spectator involvementedit ===
the competition element of sport along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played this has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport
both amateur and professional sports attract spectators both in person at the sport venue and through broadcast mediums including radio television and internet broadcast both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge such as an entrance ticket or pay-per-view television broadcast
it is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures the football world cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 cricket world cup final attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in india alone

== issues and considerationsedit ==
=== amateur and professionaledit ===
sport can be undertaken on an amateur professional or semi-professional basis depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or salary) amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called grassroots sport
the popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages which can run into millions of dollars
some sports or individual competitions within a sport retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport the olympic games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practiced a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby from 1971 olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship and from 1986 the ioc decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the olympics with the exceptions of boxing and wrestling
=== technologyedit ===
technology plays an important part in modern sports with it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport) it is used in others to improve performance some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making
sports science is a widespread academic discipline and can be applied to areas including athlete performance such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique or to equipment such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport from analytics and big data to wearable technology in order to control the impact of technology on fair play governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants for example in 2010 full-body non-textile swimsuits were banned by fina as they were enhancing swimmers performances
in 2014 new technology led to the introduction of hybrid engines in formula one in 2014 as a way of increasing fuel efficiency the cars use an energy recovery system similar to but more effective than the kers system that was previously used which recovers energy from braking and the exhaust another innovation is the drag reduction system which involves opening a slot in a car's rear wing to reduce aerodynamic drag in order to increase top speed and promote overtaking in motor racing it has been used in formula one since 2011 formula renault 3.5 since 2012 and deutsche tourenwagen masters since 2013
the increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken or reviewed off-field with another official using instant replays to make decisions in some sports players can now challenge decisions made by officials in football goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not the technology is not compulsory but was used in the 2014 fifa world cup in brazil and the 2015 fifa women's world cup in canada as well as in the premier league from 201314 and the bundesliga from 201516 in the nfl a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays the final decision rests with the referee a video referee (commonly known as a television match official or tmo) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (both league and union) in international cricket an umpire can ask the third umpire for a decision and the third umpire makes the final decision since 2008 a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in icc-run tournaments and optionally in other matches depending on the host broadcaster a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review including instant replays hawk-eye hot spot and real time snickometer hawk-eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions
=== politicsedit ===
sports and politics can influence each other greatly
benito mussolini used the 1934 fifa world cup which was held in italy to showcase fascist italy adolf hitler also used the 1936 summer olympics held in berlin and the 1936 winter olympics held in garmisch-partenkirchen to promote the nazi ideology of the superiority of the aryan race and inferiority of the jews and other undesirables germany used the olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war
when apartheid was the official policy in south africa many sports people particularly in rugby union adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects
in the history of ireland gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing gaelic football hurling or other sports administered by the gaelic athletic association (gaa) if she/he played or supported football or other games seen to be of british origin until recently the gaa continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at gaelic venues this ban is still enforced but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in croke park while lansdowne road was redeveloped into aviva stadium until recently under rule 21 the gaa also banned members of the british security forces and members of the ruc from playing gaelic games but the advent of the good friday agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban
nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sports or in its reporting people compete in national teams or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view on occasion such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue as in the football war these trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants
a very famous case when sports and politics collided was the 1972 olympics in munich masked men entered the hotel of the israeli olympic team and killed many of their men this was known as the munich massacre
a study of us elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of science showed that when the home team wins the game before the election the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent a loss had the opposite effect and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses also when washington redskins win their final game before an election then the incumbent president is more likely to win and if the redskins lose then the opposition candidate is more likely to win this has become known as the redskins rule
