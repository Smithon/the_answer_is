the electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation the "electromagnetic spectrum" of an object has a different meaning and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object
the electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short-wavelength (high-frequency) end thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom the limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the planck length until the middle of last century it was believed by most physicists that this spectrum was infinite and continuous
most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions as ways to study and characterize matter in addition radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing (see electromagnetic radiation for more applications)
== history of electromagnetic spectrum discoveryedit ==
for most of history visible light was the only known part of the electromagnetic spectrum the ancient greeks recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of its properties including reflection and refraction the study of light continued and during the 16th and 17th centuries conflicting theories regarded light as either a wave or a particle
the first discovery of electromagnetic radiation other than visible light came in 1800 when william herschel discovered infrared radiation he was studying the temperature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism he noticed that the highest temperature was beyond red he theorized that this temperature change was due to "calorific rays" that were a type of light ray that could not be seen
the next year johann ritter working at the other end of the spectrum noticed what he called "chemical rays" (invisible light rays that induced certain chemical reactions) these behaved similarly to visible violet light rays but were beyond them in the spectrum they were later renamed ultraviolet radiation
electromagnetic radiation had been first linked to electromagnetism in 1845 when michael faraday noticed that the polarization of light traveling through a transparent material responded to a magnetic field (see faraday effect) during the 1860s james maxwell developed four partial differential equations for the electromagnetic field two of these equations predicted the possibility of and behavior of waves in the field analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known speed of light this startling coincidence in value led maxwell to make the inference that light itself is a type of electromagnetic wave
maxwell's equations predicted an infinite number of frequencies of electromagnetic waves all traveling at the speed of light this was the first indication of the existence of the entire electromagnetic spectrum
maxwell's predicted waves included waves at very low frequencies compared to infrared which in theory might be created by oscillating charges in an ordinary electrical circuit of a certain type attempting to prove maxwell's equations and detect such low frequency electromagnetic radiation in 1886 the physicist heinrich hertz built an apparatus to generate and detect what is now called radio waves hertz found the waves and was able to infer (by measuring their wavelength and multiplying it by their frequency) that they traveled at the speed of light hertz also demonstrated that the new radiation could be both reflected and refracted by various dielectric media in the same manner as light for example hertz was able to focus the waves using a lens made of tree resin in a later experiment hertz similarly produced and measured the properties of microwaves these new types of waves paved the way for inventions such as the wireless telegraph and the radio
in 1895 wilhelm rntgen noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment with an evacuated tube subjected to a high voltage he called these radiations x-rays and found that they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected or stopped by denser matter such as bones before long many uses were found for them in the field of medicine
the last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of gamma rays in 1900 paul villard was studying the radioactive emissions of radium when he identified a new type of radiation that he first thought consisted of particles similar to known alpha and beta particles but with the power of being far more penetrating than either however in 1910 british physicist william henry bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation not particles and in 1914 ernest rutherford (who had named them gamma rays in 1903 when he realized that they were fundamentally different from charged alpha and beta particles) and edward andrade measured their wavelengths and found that gamma rays were similar to x-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies
== range of the spectrumedit ==
electromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the frequency f wavelength  or photon energy e frequencies observed in astronomy range from 70232399999999999992.41023 hz (1 gev gamma rays) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium (~1 khz) wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be as long as the universe photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion electron volts) while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a femtoelectronvolt) these relations are illustrated by the following equations:
where:
c = 7008299792458000000299792458 m/s is the speed of light in a vacuum
h = 69666626068959999996.62606896(33)1034 js = 69854135667330000004.13566733(10)1015 evs is planck's constant
whenever electromagnetic waves exist in a medium with matter their wavelength is decreased wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation no matter what medium they are traveling through are usually quoted in terms of the vacuum wavelength although this is not always explicitly stated
generally electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into radio wave microwave terahertz (or sub-millimeter) radiation infrared the visible region is perceived as light ultraviolet x-rays and gamma rays the behavior of em radiation depends on its wavelength when em radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per quantum (photon) it carries
spectroscopy can detect a much wider region of the em spectrum than the visible range of 400 nm to 700 nm a common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2 nm to 2500 nm detailed information about the physical properties of objects gases or even stars can be obtained from this type of device spectroscopes are widely used in astrophysics for example many hydrogen atoms emit a radio wave photon that has a wavelength of 21.12 cm also frequencies of 30 hz and below can be produced by and are important in the study of certain stellar nebulae and frequencies as high as 70272900000000000002.91027 hz have been detected from astrophysical sources
== rationale for spectrum regional namesedit ==
electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways across the spectrum these types of interaction are so different that historically different names have been applied to different parts of the spectrum as though these were different types of radiation thus although these "different kinds" of electromagnetic radiation form a quantitatively continuous spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths the spectrum remains divided for practical reasons related to these qualitative interaction differences
== types of radiationedit ==
=== boundariesedit ===
a discussion of the regions (or bands or types) of the electromagnetic spectrum is given below note that there are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; rather they fade into each other like the bands in a rainbow (which is the sub-spectrum of visible light) radiation of each frequency and wavelength (or in each band) has a mix of properties of the two regions of the spectrum that bound it for example red light resembles infrared radiation in that it can excite and add energy to some chemical bonds and indeed must do so to power the chemical mechanisms responsible for photosynthesis and the working of the visual system
=== regions of the spectrumedit ===
the types of electromagnetic radiation are broadly classified into the following classes:
gamma radiation
x-ray radiation
ultraviolet radiation
visible radiation
infrared radiation
terahertz radiation
microwave radiation
radio waves
this classification goes in the increasing order of wavelength which is characteristic of the type of radiation while in general the classification scheme is accurate in reality there is often some overlap between neighboring types of electromagnetic energy for example slf radio waves at 60 hz may be received and studied by astronomers or may be ducted along wires as electric power although the latter is in the strict sense not electromagnetic radiation at all (see near and far field)
the distinction between x-rays and gamma rays is partly based on sources: the photons generated from nuclear decay or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process are always termed gamma rays whereas x-rays are generated by electronic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons in general nuclear transitions are much more energetic than electronic transitions so gamma-rays are more energetic than x-rays but exceptions exist by analogy to electronic transitions muonic atom transitions are also said to produce x-rays even though their energy may exceed 6 megaelectronvolts (0.96 pj) whereas there are many (77 known to be less than 10 kev (1.6 fj)) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g. the 7.6 ev (1.22 aj) nuclear transition of thorium-229) and despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic x-rays the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin
the convention that em radiation that is known to come from the nucleus is always called "gamma ray" radiation is the only convention that is universally respected however many astronomical gamma ray sources (such as gamma ray bursts) are known to be too energetic (in both intensity and wavelength) to be of nuclear origin quite often in high energy physics and in medical radiotherapy very high energy emr (in the >10 mev region)which is of higher energy than any nuclear gamma rayis not called x-ray or gamma-ray but instead by the generic term of "high energy photons."
the region of the spectrum where a particular observed electromagnetic radiation falls is reference frame-dependent (due to the doppler shift for light) so em radiation that one observer would say is in one region of the spectrum could appear to an observer moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with respect to the first to be in another part of the spectrum for example consider the cosmic microwave background it was produced when matter and radiation decoupled by the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms to the ground state these photons were from lyman series transitions putting them in the ultraviolet (uv) part of the electromagnetic spectrum now this radiation has undergone enough cosmological red shift to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers moving slowly (compared to the speed of light) with respect to the cosmos
=== radio frequencyedit ===
radio waves generally are utilized by antennas of appropriate size (according to the principle of resonance) with wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to about one millimeter they are used for transmission of data via modulation television mobile phones wireless networking and amateur radio all use radio waves the use of the radio spectrum is regulated by many governments through frequency allocation
radio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the amplitude frequency and phase of the wave within a frequency band when em radiation impinges upon a conductor it couples to the conductor travels along it and induces an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material this effect (the skin effect) is used in antennas
=== microwavesedit ===
the super-high frequency (shf) and extremely high frequency (ehf) of microwaves are on the short side of radio waves microwaves are waves that are typically short enough (measured in millimeters) to employ tubular metal waveguides of reasonable diameter microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes and with solid state diodes such as gunn and impatt devices microwaves are absorbed by molecules that have a dipole moment in liquids in a microwave oven this effect is used to heat food low-intensity microwave radiation is used in wi-fi although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating
volumetric heating as used by microwave ovens transfers energy through the material electromagnetically not as a thermal heat flux the benefit of this is a more uniform heating and reduced heating time; microwaves can heat material in less than 1% of the time of conventional heating methods
when active the average microwave oven is powerful enough to cause interference at close range with poorly shielded electromagnetic fields such as those found in mobile medical devices and poorly made consumer electronics
=== terahertz radiationedit ===
terahertz radiation is a region of the spectrum between far infrared and microwaves until recently the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy at the high end of the band (sub-millimeter waves or so-called terahertz waves) but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment
=== infrared radiationedit ===
the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300 ghz to 400 thz (1 mm - 750 nm) it can be divided into three parts:
far-infrared from 300 ghz to 30 thz (1 mm - 10 m) the lower part of this range may also be called microwaves or terahertz waves this radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules by molecular motions in liquids and by phonons in solids the water in earth's atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque however there are certain wavelength ranges ("windows") within the opaque range that allow partial transmission and can be used for astronomy the wavelength range from approximately 200 m up to a few mm is often referred to as "sub-millimeter" in astronomy reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 m
mid-infrared from 30 to 120 thz (10 - 2.5 m) hot objects (black-body radiators) can radiate strongly in this range and human skin at normal body temperature radiates strongly at the lower end of this region this radiation is absorbed by molecular vibrations where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions this range is sometimes called the fingerprint region since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound
near-infrared from 120 to 400 thz (2,500 - 750 nm) physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light the highest frequences in this region can be detected directly by some types of photographic film and by many types of solid state image sensors for infrared photography and videography
=== visible radiation (light)edit ===
above infrared in frequency comes visible light the sun emits its peak power in the visible region although integrating the entire emission power spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light by definition visible light is the part of the em spectrum the human eye is the most sensitive to visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another this action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis the light that excites the human visual system is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum a rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with ultraviolet appearing just beyond the violet end
electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760 nm (400790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light other wavelengths especially near infrared (longer than 760 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant white light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum passing white light through a prism splits it up into the several colors of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400 nm and 780 nm
if radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the em spectrum reflects off an object say a bowl of fruit and then strikes the eyes this results in visual perception of the scene the brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues and through this insufficiently-understood psychophysical phenomenon most people perceive a bowl of fruit
at most wavelengths however the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses natural sources produce em radiation across the spectrum and technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths optical fiber transmits light that although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum (it is usually infrared) can carry information the modulation is similar to that used with radio waves
=== ultraviolet radiationedit ===
next in frequency comes ultraviolet (uv) the wavelength of uv rays is shorter than the violet end of the visible spectrum but longer than the x-ray
uv in the very shortest wavelength range (next to x-rays) is capable of ionizing atoms (see photoelectric effect) greatly changing their physical behavior
at the middle range of uv uv rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds making molecules unusually reactive sunburn for example is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range uv radiation on skin cells which is the main cause of skin cancer uv rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex dna molecules in the cells producing thymine dimers making it a very potent mutagen
the sun emits significant uv radiation (about 10% of its total power) including extremely short wavelength uv that could potentially destroy most life on land (ocean water would provide some protection for life there) however most of the sun's damaging uv wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere and ozone layer before they reach the surface the higher energy (shortest wavelength) ranges of uv (called "vacuum uv") are absorbed by nitrogen and at longer wavelengths by simple diatomic oxygen in the air most of the uv in the mid-range of energy is blocked by the ozone layer which absorbs strongly in the important 200315 nm range the lower energy part of which is too long for ordinary dioxygen in air to absorb the very lowest energy range of uv between 315 nm and visible light (called uv-a) is not blocked well by the atmosphere but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage however it is not harmless and does create oxygen radicals mutations and skin damage see ultraviolet for more information
=== x-raysedit ===
after uv come x-rays which like the upper ranges of uv are also ionizing however due to their higher energies x-rays can also interact with matter by means of the compton effect hard x-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft x-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption they can be used to 'see through' objects with 'thicknesses' less than that equivalent to a few meters of water one notable use is diagnostic x-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as radiography) x-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics in astronomy the accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes emit x-rays enabling studies of these phenomena x-rays are also emitted by the coronas of stars and are strongly emitted by some types of nebulae however x-ray telescopes must be placed outside the earth's atmosphere to see astronomical x-rays since the great depth of the atmosphere of earth is opaque to x-rays (with areal density of 1000 grams per cm2) equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water this is an amount sufficient to block almost all astronomical x-rays (and also astronomical gamma rayssee below)
=== gamma raysedit ===
after hard x-rays come gamma rays which were discovered by paul villard in 1900 these are the most energetic photons having no defined lower limit to their wavelength in astronomy they are valuable for studying high-energy objects or regions however as with x-rays this can only be done with telescopes outside the earth's atmosphere gamma rays are used experimentally by physicists for their penetrating ability and are produced by a number of radioisotopes they are used for irradiation of foods and seeds for sterilization and in medicine they are occasionally used in radiation cancer therapy more commonly gamma rays are used for diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine an example being pet scans the wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy through the effects of compton scattering
