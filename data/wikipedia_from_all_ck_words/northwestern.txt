a mineral is a naturally occurring substance representable by a chemical formula that is usually solid and inorganic and has a crystal structure it is different from a rock which can be an aggregate of minerals or non-minerals and does not have a specific chemical composition the exact definition of a mineral is under debate especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic and to a lesser extent with regard to it having an ordered atomic structure the study of minerals is called mineralogy
there are over 5,300 known mineral species over 5,070 of these have been approved by the international mineralogical association (ima) the silicate minerals compose over 90% of the earth's crust the diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by the earth's chemistry silicon and oxygen constitute approximately 75% of the earth's crust which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish various species and these properties in turn are influenced by the mineral's geological environment of formation changes in the temperature pressure or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals
minerals can be described by various physical properties which relate to their chemical structure and composition common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and habit hardness lustre diaphaneity colour streak tenacity cleavage fracture parting and specific gravity more specific tests for minerals include magnetism taste or smell radioactivity and reaction to acid
minerals are classified by key chemical constituents the two dominant systems are the dana classification and the strunz classification the silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of polymerization in the chemical structure all silicate minerals have a base unit of a [sio4]4 silica tetrahedrathat is a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen anions which gives the shape of a tetrahedron these tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses orthosilicates (no polymerization thus single tetrahedra) disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together) cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra) inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra) phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra) and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra) other important mineral groups include the native elements sulfides oxides halides carbonates sulfates and phosphates
== definitionedit ==
=== basic definitionedit ===
the general definition of a mineral encompasses the following criteria
naturally occurring
stable at room temperature
represented by a chemical formula
usually abiogenic (not resulting from the activity of living organisms)
ordered atomic arrangement
the first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two the first criterion means that a mineral has to form by a natural process which excludes anthropogenic compounds stability at room temperature in the simplest sense is synonymous to the mineral being solid more specifically a compound has to be stable or metastable at 25 c classical examples of exceptions to this rule include native mercury which crystallizes at 39 c and water ice which is solid only below 0 c as these two minerals were described prior to 1959 they were grandfathered by the international mineralogical association (ima) modern advances have included extensive study of liquid crystals which also extensively involve mineralogy minerals are chemical compounds and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution for example the olivine group is described by the variable formula (mg fe)2sio4 which is a solid solution of two end-member species magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite which are described by a fixed chemical formula mineral species themselves could have a variable compositions such as the sulfide mackinawite (fe ni)9s8 which is mostly a ferrous sulfide but has a very significant nickel impurity that is reflected in its formula
the requirement that a valid mineral species be abiogenic has also been described as similar to being inorganic however this criterion is imprecise and organic compounds have been assigned a separate classification branch finally the requirement of an ordered atomic arrangement is usually synonymous with crystallinity however crystals are also periodic so the broader criterion is used instead an ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of macroscopic physical properties such as crystal form hardness and cleavage there have been several recent proposals to amend the definition to consider biogenic or amorphous substances as minerals the formal definition of a mineral approved by the ima in 1995
a mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.
in addition biogenic substances were explicitly excluded
biogenic substances are chemical compounds produced entirely by biological processes without a geological component (e.g. urinary calculi oxalate crystals in plant tissues shells of marine molluscs etc.) and are not regarded as minerals however if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound then the product can be accepted as a mineral.
=== recent advancesedit ===
mineral classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science recent changes have included the addition of an organic class in both the new dana and the strunz classification schemes the organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with hydrocarbons the ima commission on new minerals and mineral names adopted in 2009 a hierarchical scheme for the naming and classification of mineral groups and group names and established seven commissions and four working groups to review and classify minerals into an official listing of their published names according to these new rules mineral species can be grouped in a number of different ways on the basis of chemistry crystal structure occurrence association genetic history or resource for example depending on the purpose to be served by the classification.
the nickel (1995) exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to for example lowenstam (1981) stated that organisms are capable of forming a diverse array of minerals some of which cannot be formed inorganically in the biosphere. the distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves skinner (2005) views all solids as potential minerals and includes biominerals in the mineral kingdom which are those that are created by the metabolic activities of organisms skinner expanded the previous definition of a mineral to classify element or compound amorphous or crystalline formed through biogeochemical processes, as a mineral
recent advances in high-resolution genetics and x-ray absorption spectroscopy are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between microorganisms and minerals that may make nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity for example the ima commissioned environmental mineralogy and geochemistry working group deals with minerals in the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere the group's scope includes mineral-forming microorganisms which exist on nearly every rock soil and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the sea floor and 70 kilometres into the stratosphere (possibly entering the mesosphere) biogeochemical cycles have contributed to the formation of minerals for billions of years microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution contributing to the formation of ore deposits they can also catalyze the dissolution of minerals
prior to the international mineralogical association's listing over 60 biominerals had been discovered named and published these minerals (a sub-set tabulated in lowenstam (1981)) are considered minerals proper according to the skinner (2005) definition these biominerals are not listed in the international mineral association official list of mineral names however many of these biomineral representatives are distributed amongst the 78 mineral classes listed in the dana classification scheme another rare class of minerals (primarily biological in origin) include the mineral liquid crystals that have properties of both liquids and crystals to date over 80,000 liquid crystalline compounds have been identified
the skinner (2005) definition of a mineral takes this matter into account by stating that a mineral can be crystalline or amorphous the latter group including liquid crystals although biominerals and liquid mineral crystals are not the most common form of minerals they help to define the limits of what constitutes a mineral proper the formal nickel (1995) definition explicitly mentioned crystallinity as a key to defining a substance as a mineral a 2011 article defined icosahedrite an aluminium-iron-copper alloy as mineral named for its unique natural icosahedral symmetry it is a quasicrystal unlike a true crystal quasicrystals are ordered but not periodic
=== rocks ores and gemsedit ===
minerals are not equivalent to rocks a rock is either an aggregate of one or more minerals or not composed of minerals at all rocks like limestone or quartzite are composed primarily of one mineralcalcite or aragonite in the case of limestone and quartz in the latter case other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals a granite is defined by proportions of quartz alkali feldspar and plagioclase feldspar the other minerals in the rock are termed accessory and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material coal is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon
in rocks some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others these are termed the rock-forming minerals the major examples of these are quartz the feldspars the micas the amphiboles the pyroxenes the olivines and calcite except the last one all of the minerals are silicates overall around 150 minerals are considered particularly important whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting
commercially valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as industrial minerals for example muscovite a white mica can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass) as a filler or as an insulator ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element typically a metal examples are cinnabar (hgs) an ore of mercury sphalerite (zns) an ore of zinc or cassiterite (sno2) an ore of tin gems are minerals with an ornamental value and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty durability and usually rarity there are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones gem minerals are often present in several varieties and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones for example ruby and sapphire are both corundum al2o3
=== nomenclature and classificationedit ===
minerals are classified by variety species series and group in order of increasing generality the basic level of definition is that of mineral species which is distinguished from other species by specific and unique chemical and physical properties for example quartz is defined by its formula sio2 and a specific crystalline structure that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed polymorphs) when there exists a range of composition between two minerals species a mineral series is defined for example the biotite series is represented by variable amounts of the endmembers phlogopite siderophyllite annite and eastonite in contrast a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure the pyroxene group has a common formula of xy(si,al)2o6 where x and y are both cations with x typically bigger than y the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the orthorhombic or monoclinic crystal systems finally a mineral variety is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic such as colour or crystal habit an example is amethyst which is a purple variety of quartz
two common classifications dana and strunz are used for minerals both rely on composition specifically with regards to important chemical groups and structure james dwight dana a leading geologist of his time first published his system of mineralogy in 1837 as of 1997 it is in its eighth edition the dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species its class number is based on important compositional groups the type gives the ratio of cations to anions in the mineral and the last two numbers group minerals by structural similarity within a given type or class the less commonly used strunz classification named for german mineralogist karl hugo strunz is based on the dana system but combines both chemical and structural criteria the latter with regards to distribution of chemical bonds
there are over 5,069 approved mineral species they are most commonly named after a person (45%) followed by discovery location (23%) names based on chemical composition (14%) and physical properties (8%) are the two other major groups of mineral name etymologies the common suffix -ite of mineral names descends from the ancient greek suffix - (-ites) meaning connected with or belonging to
== mineral chemistryedit ==
the abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the earth the majority of minerals observed are derived from the earth's crust eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals due to their abundance in the crust these eight elements summing to over 98% of the crust by weight are in order of decreasing abundance oxygen silicon aluminium iron magnesium calcium sodium and potassium oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important oxygen composes 46.6% of the crust by weight and silicon accounts for 27.7%
the minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body for example a magma rich in iron and magnesium will form mafic minerals such as olivine and the pyroxenes in contrast a more silica-rich magma will crystallize to form minerals than incorporate more sio2 such as the feldspars and quartz in a limestone calcite or aragonite (both caco3) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate a corollary is that a mineral will not be found in a rock whose bulk chemistry does not resemble the bulk chemistry of a given mineral with the exception of trace minerals for example kyanite al2sio5 forms from the metamorphism of aluminium-rich shales it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock such quartzite
the chemical composition may vary between end member species of a solid solution series for example the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (naalsi3o8) to calcium-rich anorthite (caal2si2o8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich) oligoclase andesine labradorite and bytownite other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hbnerite and iron-rich ferberite
chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals in nature minerals are not pure substances and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system as a result it is possible for one element to be substituted for another chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge for example k+ will not substitute for si4+ because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge a common example of chemical substitution is that of si4+ by al3+ which are close in charge size and abundance in the crust in the example of plagioclase there are three cases of substitution feldspars are all framework silicates which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1 and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of si4+ by al3+ to give a base unit of [alsi3o8] without the substitution the formula would be charge-balanced as sio2 giving quartz the significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra the second substitution occurs between na+ and ca2+ however the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of si4+ by al3+
coordination polyhedra are geometric representation of how a cation is surrounded by an anion in mineralogy due its abundance in the crust coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen the base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron one si4+ surrounded by four o2 an alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number in the case of the silica tetrahedron the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4 various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers for silicon it is almost always 4 except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination by oxygen bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too) changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences for example at high pressure such as in the mantle many minerals especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a perovskite structure where silicon is in octahedral coordination another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite andalusite and sillimanite (polymorphs as they share the formula al2sio5) which differ by the coordination number of the al3+ these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature in the case of silicate materials the substitution of si4+ by al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges
changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample changes in composition can be caused by processes such as weathering or metasomatism (hydrothermal alteration) changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes tectonic or magmatic movement into differing physical regimes changes in thermodynamic conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals as such it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy this process of mineralogical alteration is related to the rock cycle an example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows
orthoclase feldspar (kalsi3o8) is a mineral commonly found in granite a plutonic igneous rock when exposed to weathering it reacts to form kaolinite (al2si2o5(oh)4 a sedimentary mineral and silicic acid)
2 kalsi3o8 + 5 h2o + 2 h+ al2si2o5(oh)4 + 4 h2sio3 + 2 k+
under low-grade metamorphic conditions kaolinite reacts with quartz to form pyrophyllite (al2si4o10(oh)2)
al2si2o5(oh)4 + sio2 al2si4o10(oh)2 + h2o
as metamorphic grade increases the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz
al2si4o10(oh)2 al2sio5 + 3 sio2 + h2o
alternatively a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting for example quartz will change into a variety of its sio2 polymorphs such as tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures and coesite at high pressures
== physical properties of mineralsedit ==
classifying minerals ranges from simple to difficult a mineral can be identified by several physical properties some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation in other cases minerals can only be classified by more complex optical chemical or x-ray diffraction analysis these methods however can be costly and time-consuming physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit hardness lustre diaphaneity colour streak cleavage and fracture and specific gravity other less general tests include fluorescence phosphorescence magnetism radioactivity tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form) piezoelectricity and reactivity to dilute acids
=== crystal structure and habitedit ===
crystal structure results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral this crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or ionic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by x-ray diffraction minerals are typically described by their symmetry content crystals are restricted to 32 point groups which differ by their symmetry these groups are classified in turn into more broad categories the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families
these families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes and the angles between them these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups they are summarized below a b and c represent the axes and   represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g is the angle opposite the a-axis viz the angle between the b and c axes)
the hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal systems the trigonal which has a three-fold axis of symmetry and the hexagonal which has a six-fold axis of symmetry
chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral with a restriction to 32 point groups minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure for example halite (nacl) galena (pbs) and periclase (mgo) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family) as they have a similar stoichiometry between their different constituent elements in contrast polymorphs are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure for example pyrite and marcasite both iron sulfides have the formula fes2 however the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic this polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic ax2 formula these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups
polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content the aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals kyanite andalusite and sillimanite which share the chemical formula al2sio5 kyanite is triclinic while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group these difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure in all minerals one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen the silicon as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals an exception is a case like stishovite (sio2 an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure) in kyanite the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination its chemical formula can be expressed as al[6]al[6]sio5 to reflect its crystal structure andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (al[6]al[5]sio5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (al[6]al[4]sio5)
differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral the carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties diamond is the hardest natural substance has an adamantine lustre and belongs to the isometric crystal family whereas as graphite is very soft has a greasy lustre and crystallises in the hexagonal family this difference is accounted by differences in bonding in diamond the carbons are in sp3 hybrid orbitals which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to three neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion on the other hand graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp2 hybrid orbitals where each carbon is bonded covalently to only two others these sheets are held together by much weaker van der waals forces and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences
twinning is the intergrowth of two or more crystal of a single mineral species the geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry as a result there are several types of twins including contact twins reticulated twins geniculated twins penetration twins cyclic twins and polysynthetic twins contact or simple twins consist of two crystals joined at a plane this type of twinning is common in spinel reticulated twins common in rutile are interlocking crystals resembling netting geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and carlsbad twinning in orthoclase cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis it occurs around three four five six or eight-fold axes and the corresponding patterns are called threelings fourlings fivelings sixlings and eightlings sixlings are common in aragonite polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning however instead of occurring around a rotational axis it occurs along parallel planes usually on a microscopic scale
crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal several terms are used to describe this property common habits include acicular which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite bladed dendritic (tree-pattern common in native copper) equant which is typical of garnet prismatic (elongated in one direction) and tabular which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation related to crystal form the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals especially with a petrographic microscope euhedral crystals have a defined external shape while anhedral crystals do not those intermediate forms are termed subhedral
=== hardnessedit ===
the hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching this physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral a mineral's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides which is a function of its structure crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others an example of this property exists in kyanite which has a mohs hardness of 5 parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100]
the most common scale of measurement is the ordinal mohs hardness scale defined by ten indicators a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it the scale ranges from talc a phyllosilicate to diamond a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material the scale is provided below
=== lustre and diaphaneityedit ===
lustre indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface with regards to its quality and intensity there are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite non-metallic lustres include adamantine such as in diamond vitreous which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals pearly such as in talc and apophyllite resinous such as members of the garnet group silky which common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform chrysotile
the diaphaneity of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through it an example of such a mineral is muscovite (potassium mica) some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows translucent minerals allow some light to pass but less than those that are transparent jadeite and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property) minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque
the diaphaneity of a mineral depends on thickness of the sample when a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g. in a thin section for petrography) it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in hand sample in contrast some minerals such as hematite or pyrite are opaque even in thin-section
=== colour and streakedit ===
colour is the most obvious property of a mineral but it is often non-diagnostic it is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except in the case of incandescence which does not apply to minerals) two broad classes of elements are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue) in contrast allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities an example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum the colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of interference of light waves examples include labradorite and bornite
in addition to simple body colour minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties such as play of colours asterism chatoyancy iridescence tarnish and pleochroism several of these properties involve variability in colour play of colour such as in opal results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal cleavage planes or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry in contrast the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated asterism a variety of chatoyancy gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain the latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum
the streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form which may or may not be identical to its body colour the most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black the streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements or any weathering surface a common example of this property is illustrated with hematite which is coloured black silver or red in hand sample but has a cherry-red to reddish-brown streak streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral as those harder than 7 powder the streak plate instead
=== cleavage parting fracture and tenacityedit ===
by definition minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage the quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks common descriptors in order of decreasing quality are perfect good distinct and poor in particularly transparent mineral or in thin-section cleavage can be seen a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed at a side cleavage is not a universal property among minerals for example quartz consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave in contrast micas which have perfect basal cleavage consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together
as cleavage is a function of crystallography there are a variety of cleavage types cleavage occurs typically in either one two three four or six directions basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions at 90 when three directions of cleavage are present but not at 90 such as in calcite or rhodochrosite it is termed rhombohedral cleavage octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage
minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions for example calcite has good cleavage in three direction but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction and poor cleavage in two other directions angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals for example as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates the angle between their cleavage planes is different the pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90 whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120 and 60 the cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer which is similar to a protractor
parting sometimes called false cleavage is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral as opposed to systematic weakness parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property in general parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal the sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g an increase in pressure) exsolution or twinning minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes hematite magnetite and corundum
when a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage it is termed to have been fractured there are several types of uneven fracture the classic example is conchoidal fracture like that of quartz rounded surfaces are created which are marked by smooth curved lines this type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals other types of fracture are fibrous splintery and hackly the latter describes a break along a rough jagged surface an example of this property is found in native copper
tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking minerals can be described as brittle ductile malleable sectile flexible or elastic
=== specific gravityedit ===
specific gravity numerically describes the density of a mineral the dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units kg/m3 or g/cm3 specific gravity measures how much water a mineral sample displaces defined as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water specific gravity is a unitless ratio among most minerals this property is not diagnostic rock forming minerals typically silicates or occasionally carbonates have a specific gravity of 2.53.5
high specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral a variation in chemistry (and consequently mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity among more common minerals oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass a generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre for example hematite fe2o3 has a specific gravity of 5.26 while galena pbs has a specific gravity of 7.27.6 which is a result of their high iron and lead content respectively a very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in native metals kamacite an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a specific gravity of 7.9 and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3
=== other propertiesedit ===
other properties can be used to diagnose minerals these are less general and apply to specific minerals
dropping dilute acid (often 10% hcl) aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes the acid reacts with the carbonate ([co3]2) group which causes the affected area to effervesce giving off carbon dioxide gas this test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered an example of this test is done when distinguish calcite from dolomite especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively) calcite immediately effervesces in acid whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock) for it to effervesce zeolite minerals will not effervesce in acid instead they become frosted after 510 minutes and if left in acid for a day they dissolve or become a silica gel
when tested magnetism is a very conspicuous property of minerals among common minerals magnetite exhibits this property strongly and it is also present albeit not as strongly in pyrrhotite and ilmenite
minerals can also be tested for taste or smell halite nacl is table salt its potassium-bearing counterpart sylvite has a pronounced bitter taste sulfides have a characteristic smell especially as samples are fractured reacting or powdered
radioactivity is a rare property minerals may be composed of radioactive elements they could be a defining constituent such as uranium in uraninite autunite and carnotite or as trace impurities in the latter case the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal the result termed a radioactive halo or pleochroic halo is observable by various techniques such as thin-section petrography
== mineral classesedit ==
as the composition of the earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity however non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance especially as ores
non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry which included native elements sulfides halides oxides and hydroxides carbonates and nitrates borates sulfates phosphates and organic compounds the majority of non-silicate mineral species are extremely rare (constituting in total 8% of the earth's crust) although some are relative common such as calcite pyrite magnetite and hematite there are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra the close-packed structures which is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab") whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc") analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include so4 (sulfate) po4 (phosphate) aso4 (arsenate) and vo4 (vanadate) the non-silicates have great economic importance as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do
the largest grouping of minerals by far are the silicates most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals and over 90% of the earth's crust is composed of these minerals the two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen which are the two most abundant elements in the earth's crust other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the earth's crust such aluminium magnesium iron calcium sodium and potassium some important rock-forming silicates include the feldspars quartz olivines pyroxenes amphiboles garnets and micas
=== silicatesedit ===
the base of unit of a silicate mineral is the [sio4]4 tetrahedron in the vast majority of cases silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen in very high-pressure situations silicon will be six-fold or octahedral coordination such as in the perovskite structure or the quartz polymorph stishovite (sio2) in the latter case the mineral no longer has a silicate structure but that of rutile (tio2) and its associated group which are simple oxides these silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures such as one-dimensional chains two-dimensional sheets and three-dimensional frameworks the basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge in other silicate structures different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge it is common for the si4+ to be substituted by al3+ because of similarity in ionic radius and charge in those case the [alo4]5 tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra but their charge-balancing requirements are different
the degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites) orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra thus tetrahedra share no corners disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom inosilicates are chain silicates single-chain silicates have two shared corners whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners in phyllosilicates a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens in the case of double-chain silicates some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result framework silicates or tectosilicates have tetrahedra that share all four corners the ring silicates or cyclosilicates only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure
the silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization
==== tectosilicatesedit ====
tectosilicates also known as framework silicates have the highest degree of polymerization with all corners of a tetrahedra shared the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2 examples are quartz the feldspars feldspathoids and the zeolites framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds
forming 12% of the earth's crust quartz (sio2) is the most abundant mineral species it is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity quartz has several polymorphs including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures high-pressure coesite and ultra-high pressure stishovite the latter mineral can only be formed on earth by meteorite impacts and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (tio2) the silica polymorph that is most stable at the earth's surface is -quartz its counterpart -quartz is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to -quartz below 573 c at 1 bar) these two polymorphs differ by a kinking of bonds this change in structure gives -quartz greater symmetry than -quartz and they are thus also called high quartz () and low quartz ()
feldspars are the most abundant group in the earth's crust at about 50% in the feldspars al3+ substitutes for si4+ which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations the base structure becomes either [alsi3o8] or [al2si2o8]2 there are 22 mineral species of feldspars subdivided into two major subgroupsalkali and plagioclaseand two less common groupscelsian and banalsite the alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich albite in the case of plagioclase the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich anorthite crystal twinning is common in feldspars especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars if the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt it forms exsolution lamellae because the two componentsorthoclase and albiteare unstable in solid solution exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample perthitic texture forms when na-rich feldspar exsolve in a k-rich host the opposite texture (antiperthitic) where k-rich feldspar exsolves in a na-rich host is very rare
feldsapthoids are structurally similar to feldspar but differ in that they form in si-deficient conditions which allows for further substitution by al3+ as a result feldsapthoids cannot be associated with quartz a common example of a feldsapthoid is nepheline ((na k)alsio4) compared to alkali feldspar nepheline has an al2o3:sio2 ratio of 1:2 as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits occurring in needles plates or blocky masses they form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures and have channels and voids in their structure zeolites have several industrial applications especially in waste water treatment
==== phyllosilicatesedit ====
phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra they are bound at three oxygen sites which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5 important examples include the mica chlorite and the kaolinite-serpentine groups the sheets are weakly bound by van der waals forces or hydrogen bonds which causes a crystallographic weakness in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates in addition to the tetrahedra phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra which have a negative charge (e.g [si4o10]4) these tetrahedra (t) and octahedra (o) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups within an octahedral sheet there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure however not all of the sites may be occupied in that case the mineral is termed dioctahedral whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral
the kaolinite-serpentine group consists of t-o stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals) their hardness ranges from 2 to 4 as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds the 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of t-o-t stacks but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2) as they are instead held together by van der waals forces these two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation specifically kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral
micas are also t-o-t-stacked phyllosilicates but differ from the other t-o-t and t-o-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have al3+ in octahedral sites) common examples of micas are muscovite and the biotite series the chlorite group is related to mica group but a brucite-like (mg(oh)2) layer between the t-o-t stacks
because of their chemical structure phyllosilicates typically have flexible elastic transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes micas can be used in electronics as insulators in construction as optical filler or even cosmetics chrysotile a species of serpentine is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos
==== inosilicatesedit ====
inosilicates consist of tetrahedra repeatedly bonded in chains these chains can be single where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain alternatively two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g [si2o6]4) whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11 e.g [si8o22]12 inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups single-chain silicates are most commonly pyroxenes while double-chain silicates are often amphiboles higher-order chains exist (e.g three-member four-member five-member chains etc.) but they are rare
the pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species pyroxenes have a general structure formula of xy(si2o6) where x is an octahedral site while y can vary in coordination number from six to eight most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of ca2+ fe2+ and mg2+ to balance the negative charge on the backbone pyroxenes are common in the earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks
amphiboles have great variability in chemistry described variously as a mineralogical garbage can or a mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements the backbone of the amphiboles is the [si8o22]12 it is balanced by cations in three possible positions although the third position is not always used and one element can occupy both remaining ones finally the amphiboles are usually hydrated that is they have a hydroxyl group ([oh]) although it can be replaced by a fluoride a chloride or an oxide ion because of the variable chemistry there are over 80 species of amphibole although variations as in the pyroxenes most commonly involve mixtures of ca2+ fe2+ and mg2+ several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit these asbestos minerals form long thin flexible and strong fibres which are electrical insulators chemically inert and heat-resistant as such they have several applications especially in construction materials however asbestos are known carcinogens and cause various other illnesses such as asbestosis amphibole asbestos (anthophyllite tremolite actinolite grunerite and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos
==== cyclosilicatesedit ====
cyclosilicates or ring silicates have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3 six-member rings are most common with a base structure of [si6o18]12 examples include the tourmaline group and beryl other ring structures exist with 3 4 8 9 12 having been described cyclosilicates tend to be strong with elongated striated crystals
tourmalines have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula xy3z6(bo3)3t6o18v3w the t6o18 is the basic ring structure where t is usually si4+ but substitutable by al3+ or b3+ tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the x site and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the w site the y and z sites can accommodate a variety of cations especially various transition metals this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour other cyclosilicates include beryl al2be3si6o18 whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish) cordierite is structurally similar to beryl and is a common metamorphic mineral
==== sorosilicatesedit ====
sorosilicates also termed disilicates have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen the resultant common structural element is the [si2o7]6 group the most common disilicates by far are members of the epidote group epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to metapelites epidotes are built around the structure [(sio4)(si2o7)]10 structure for example the mineral species epidote has calcium aluminium and ferric iron to charge balance ca2al2(fe3+ al)(sio4)(si2o7)o(oh) the presence of iron as fe3+ and fe2+ helps understand oxygen fugacity which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis
other examples of sorosilicates include lawsonite a metamorphic mineral forming in the blueschist facies (subduction zone setting with low temperature and high pressure) vesuvianite which takes up a significant amount of calcium in its chemical structure
==== orthosilicatesedit ====
orthosilicates consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations also termed nesosilicates this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g sio4) typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals and are fairly hard several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass such as the aluminosilicates the olivine group and the garnet group
the aluminosilicateskyanite andalusite and sillimanite all al2sio5are structurally composed of one [sio4]4 tetrahedron and one al3+ in octahedral coordination the remaining al3+ can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite) five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite) which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions in the olivine structure the main olivine series of (mg fe)2sio4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen other mineral species having this structure exist such as tephroite mn2sio4 the garnet group has a general formula of x3y2(sio4)3 where x is a large eight-fold coordinated cation and y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation there are six ideal endmembers of garnet split into two group the pyralspite garnets have al3+ in the y position pyrope (mg3al2(sio4)3) almandine (fe3al2(sio4)3) and spessartine (mn3al2(sio4)3) the ugrandite garnets have ca2+ in the x position uvarovite (ca3cr2(sio4)3) grossular (ca3al2(sio4)3) and andradite (ca3fe2(sio4)3) while there are two subgroups of garnet solid solutions exist between all six end-members
other orthosilicates include zircon staurolite and topaz zircon (zrsio4) is useful in geochronology as the zr4+ can be substituted by u6+ furthermore because of its very resistant structure it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral it has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986 topaz (al2sio4(f oh)2 often found in granitic pegmatites associated with tourmaline is a common gemstone mineral
=== non-silicatesedit ===
==== native elementsedit ====
native elements are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements this mineral group includes native metals semi-metals and non-metals and various alloys and solid solutions the metals are held together by metallic bonding which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre ductility and malleability and electrical conductivity native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes
the gold group with a cubic close-packed structure includes metals such as gold silver and copper the platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group the iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species two examples are kamacite and taenite which are found in iron meteorites these species differ by the amount of ni in the alloy kamacite has less than 57% nickel and is a variety of native iron whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 737% arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals which have only some metallic for example they lack the malleability of metals native carbon occurs in two allotropes graphite and diamond the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite
==== sulfidesedit ====
the sulfide minerals are chemical compounds of one or more metals or semimetals with a sulfur tellurium arsenic or selenium can substitute for the sulfur sulfides tend to be soft brittle minerals with a high specific gravity many powdered sulfides such as pyrite have a sulfurous smell when powdered sulfides are susceptible to weathering and many readily dissolve in water these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited which creates enriched secondary ore deposits sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur such as m:s equal to 2:1 or 1:1 many sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores examples include sphalerite (zns) an ore of zinc galena (pbs) an ore of lead cinnabar (hgs) an ore of mercury and molybdenite (mos2 an ore of molybdenum pyrite (fes2) is the most commonly occurring sulfide and can be found in most geological environments it is not however an ore of iron but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid related to the sulfides are the rare sulfosalts in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as antimony arsenic or bismuth like the sulfides sulfosalts are typically soft heavy and brittle minerals
==== oxidesedit ====
oxide minerals are divided into three categories simple oxides hydroxides and multiple oxides simple oxides are characterized by o2 as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding they can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations the periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (cu2o) and water ice corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio and includes minerals such as corundum (al2o3) and hematite (fe2o3) rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2 the eponymous species rutile (tio2) is the chief ore of titanium other examples include cassiterite (sno2 ore of tin) and pyrolusite (mno2 ore of manganese) in hydroxides the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion oh bauxites are the chief aluminium ore and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore gibbsite and bohmite they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions) finally multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen a major group within this class are the spinels with a general formula of x2+y3+2o4 examples of species include spinel (mgal2o4) chromite (fecr2o4) and magnetite (fe3o4) the latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (fe2+fe3+2o4) which makes it a multiple oxide instead of a single oxide
==== halidesedit ====
the halide minerals are compounds where a halogen (fluorine chlorine iodine and bromine) is the main anion these minerals tend to be soft weak brittle and water-soluble common examples of halides include halite (nacl table salt) sylvite (kcl) fluorite (caf2) halite and sylvite commonly form as evaporites and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks cryolite na3alf6 is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from bauxites however as the only significant occurrence at ivittuut greenland in a granitic pegmatite was depleted synthetic cryolite can be made from fluorite
==== carbonatesedit ====
the carbonate minerals are those were the main anionic group is carbonate [co3]2 carbonates tend to be brittle many have rhombohedral cleavage and all react with acid due to the last characteristic field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates the reaction of acid with carbonates most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and aragonite (caco3) relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral which is a key in the formation of limestone caves features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites and karst landforms carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments the carbonate group is structurally a triangle where a central c4+ cation is surrounded by three o2 anions different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles the most common carbonate mineral is calcite and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble calcite caco3 can have a high magnesium impurity under high-mg conditions its polymorph aragonite will form instead the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an aragonite or calcite sea depending on which mineral preferentially forms dolomite is a double carbonate with the formula camg(co3)2 secondary dolomitization of limestone is common where calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite) which can create a reservoir for oil and gas these two minerals species are members of eponymous mineral groups the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula xco3 and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with general formula xy(co3)2
==== sulfatesedit ====
the sulfate minerals all contain the sulfate anion [so4]2 they tend to be transparent to translucent soft and many are fragile sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters alternative sulfates can also be found in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides or as oxidation products of sulfides sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals the most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum caso42h2o it forms as an evaporite and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes gypsum can form desert roses gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating as such gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall the anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions the barite group has the general formula xso4 where the x is a large 12-coordinated cation examples include barite (baso4) celestine (srso4) and anglesite (pbso4) anhydrite is not part of the barite group as the smaller ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination
==== phosphatesedit ====
the phosphate minerals are characterized by the tetrahedral [po4]3 unit although the structure can be generalized and phosphorus is replaced by antimony arsenic or vanadium the most common phosphate is the apatite group common species within this group are fluorapatite (ca5(po4)3f) chlorapatite (ca5(po4)3cl) and hydroxylapatite (ca5(po4)3(oh)) minerals in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates the relatively abundant monazite group has a general structure of ato4 where t is phosphorus or arsenic and a is often a rare-earth element (ree) monazite is important in two ways first as a ree sink it can sufficiently concentrate these elements to become an ore secondly monazite group elements can incorporate relatively large amounts of uranium and thorium which can be used to date the rock based on the decay of the u and th to lead
==== organic mineralsedit ====
the strunz classification includes a class for organic minerals these rare compounds contain organic carbon but can be formed by a geologic process for example whewellite cac2o4h2o is an oxalate that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins while hydrated calcium oxalate can be found in coal seams and other sedimentary deposits involving organic matter the hydrothermal occurrence is not considered to be related to biological activity
== astrobiologyedit ==
it has been suggested that biominerals could be important indicators of extraterrestrial life and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet mars furthermore organic components (biosignatures) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and biotic reactions
on january 24 2014 nasa reported that current studies by the curiosity and opportunity rovers on mars will now be searching for evidence of ancient life including a biosphere based on autotrophic chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms as well as ancient water including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable the search for evidence of habitability taphonomy (related to fossils) and organic carbon on the planet mars is now a primary nasa objective
