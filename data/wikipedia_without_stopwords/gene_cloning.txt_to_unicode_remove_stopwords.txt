steps molecular cloning
standard molecular cloning experiments cloning dna fragment essentially involves seven steps choice host organism cloning vector preparation vector dna preparation dna cloned creation recombinant dna introduction recombinant dna host organism selection organisms containing recombinant dna screening clones desired dna inserts biological properties
although detailed planning cloning done text editor together online utilities eg pcr primer design dedicated software exist purpose software purpose include example ape open source dnastrider open source serial cloner gratis collagene open source
choice host organism cloning vector
although large number host organisms molecular cloning vectors use great majority molecular cloning experiments begin laboratory strain bacterium e coli escherichia coli plasmid cloning vector e coli plasmid vectors common use technically sophisticated versatile widely available offer rapid growth recombinant organisms minimal equipment dna cloned exceptionally large hundreds thousands millions base pairs bacterial artificial chromosome yeast artificial chromosome vector often chosen
specialized applications may call specialized hostvector systems example experimentalists wish harvest particular protein recombinant organism expression vector chosen contains appropriate signals transcription translation desired host organism alternatively replication dna different species desired example transfer dna bacteria plants multiple host range vector also termed shuttle vector may selected practice however specialized molecular cloning experiments usually begin cloning bacterial plasmid followed subcloning specialized vector
whatever combination host vector used vector almost always contains four dna segments critically important function experimental utility origin dna replication necessary vector recombinant sequences linked replicate inside host organism one unique restriction endonuclease recognition sites serves sites foreign dna may introduced selectable genetic marker gene used enable survival cells taken vector sequences additional gene used screening cells contain foreign dna
preparation vector dna
cloning vector treated restriction endonuclease cleave dna site foreign dna inserted restriction enzyme chosen generate configuration cleavage site compatible ends foreign dna see dna end typically done cleaving vector dna foreign dna restriction enzyme example ecori modern vectors contain variety convenient cleavage sites unique within vector molecule vector cleaved single site located within gene frequently betagalactosidase whose inactivation used distinguish recombinant nonrecombinant organisms later step process improve ratio recombinant nonrecombinant organisms cleaved vector may treated enzyme alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylates vector ends vector molecules dephosphorylated ends unable replicate replication restored foreign dna integrated cleavage site
preparation dna cloned
cloning genomic dna dna cloned extracted organism interest virtually tissue source used even tissues extinct animals long dna extensively degraded dna purified using simple methods remove contaminating proteins extraction phenol rna ribonuclease smaller molecules precipitation andor chromatography polymerase chain reaction pcr methods often used amplification specific dna rna rtpcr sequences prior molecular cloning

purified dna treated restriction enzyme generate fragments ends capable linked vector necessary short doublestranded segments dna linkers containing desired restriction sites may added create end structures compatible vector
creation recombinant dna dna ligase
creation recombinant dna many ways simplest step molecular cloning process dna prepared vector foreign source simply mixed together appropriate concentrations exposed enzyme dna ligase covalently links ends together joining reaction often termed ligation resulting dna mixture containing randomly joined ends ready introduction host organism
dna ligase recognizes acts ends linear dna molecules usually resulting complex mixture dna molecules randomly joined ends desired products vector dna covalently linked foreign dna present sequences eg foreign dna linked vector dna linked higherorder combinations vector foreign dna also usually present complex mixture sorted subsequent steps cloning process dna mixture introduced cells
introduction recombinant dna host organism
dna mixture previously manipulated vitro moved back living cell referred host organism methods used get dna cells varied name applied step molecular cloning process often depend upon experimental method chosen eg transformation transduction transfection electroporation
microorganisms able take replicate dna local environment process termed transformation cells physiological state take dna said competent mammalian cell culture analogous process introducing dna cells commonly termed transfection transformation transfection usually require preparation cells special growth regime chemical treatment process vary specific species cell types used
electroporation uses high voltage electrical pulses translocate dna across cell membrane cell wall present contrast transduction involves packaging dna virusderived particles using viruslike particles introduce encapsulated dna cell process resembling viral infection although electroporation transduction highly specialized methods may efficient methods move dna cells
selection organisms containing vector sequences
whichever method used introduction recombinant dna chosen host organism usually low efficiency process small fraction cells actually take dna experimental scientists deal issue step artificial genetic selection cells taken dna selectively killed cells actively replicate dna containing selectable marker gene encoded vector able survive
bacterial cells used host organisms selectable marker usually gene confers resistance antibiotic would otherwise kill cells typically ampicillin cells harboring plasmid survive exposed antibiotic failed take plasmid sequences die mammalian cells eg human mouse cells used similar strategy used except marker gene case typically encoded part kanmx cassette confers resistance antibiotic geneticin
screening clones desired dna inserts biological properties
modern bacterial cloning vectors eg puc later derivatives including pgem vectors use bluewhite screening system distinguish colonies clones transgenic cells contain parental vector ie vector dna recombinant sequence inserted vectors foreign dna inserted sequence encodes essential part betagalactosidase enzyme whose activity results formation bluecolored colony culture medium used work insertion foreign dna betagalactosidase coding sequence disables function enzyme colonies containing transformed dna remain colorless white therefore experimentalists easily able identify conduct studies transgenic bacterial clones ignoring contain recombinant dna
total population individual clones obtained molecular cloning experiment often termed dna library libraries may highly complex cloning complete genomic dna organism relatively simple moving previously cloned dna fragment different plasmid almost always necessary examine number different clones sure desired dna construct obtained may accomplished wide range experimental methods including use nucleic acid hybridizations antibody probes polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment analysis andor dna sequencing

gene therapy
gene therapy involves supplying functional gene cells lacking function aim correcting genetic disorder acquired disease gene therapy broadly divided two categories first alteration germ cells sperm eggs results permanent genetic change whole organism subsequent generations germ line gene therapy considered many unethical human beings second type gene therapy somatic cell gene therapy analogous organ transplant case one specific tissues targeted direct treatment removal tissue addition therapeutic gene genes laboratory return treated cells patient clinical trials somatic cell gene therapy began late mostly treatment cancers blood liver lung disorders
despite great deal publicity promises history human gene therapy characterized relatively limited success effect introducing gene cells often promotes partial andor transient relief symptoms disease treated gene therapy trial patients suffered adverse consequences treatment including deaths cases adverse effects result disruption essential genes within patients genome insertional inactivation others viral vectors used gene therapy contaminated infectious virus nevertheless gene therapy still held promising future area medicine area significant level research development activity
