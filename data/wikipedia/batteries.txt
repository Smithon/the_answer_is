eutrophication (greek: eutrophiahealthy adequate nutrition development; german: eutrophie) or more precisely hypertrophication is the ecosystem's response to the addition of artificial or natural nutrients mainly phosphates through detergents fertilizers or sewage to an aquatic system one example is the "bloom" or great increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients negative environmental effects include hypoxia the depletion of oxygen in the water which may cause death to aquatic animals
== mechanism of eutrophicationedit ==
eutrophication arises from the oversupply of nutrients which induces explosive growth of plants and algae which when such organisms die consume the oxygen in the body of water thereby creating the state of hypoxia
according to ullmann's encyclopedia "the primary limiting factor for eutrophication is phosphate." the availability of phosphorus generally promotes excessive plant growth and decay favouring simple algae and plankton over other more complicated plants and causes a severe reduction in water quality phosphorus is a necessary nutrient for plants to live and is the limiting factor for plant growth in many freshwater ecosystems phosphate adheres tightly to soil so it is mainly transported by erosion once translocated to lakes the extraction of phosphate into water is slow hence the difficulty of reversing the effects of eutrophication
the source of this excess phosphate are detergents industrial/domestic run-off and fertilizers with the phasing out of phosphate-containing detergents in the 1970s industrial/domestic run-off and agriculture have emerged as the dominant contributors to eutrophication
=== lakes and riversedit ===
when algae die they decompose and the nutrients contained in that organic matter are converted into inorganic form by microorganisms this decomposition process consumes oxygen which reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen the depleted oxygen levels in turn may lead to fish kills and a range of other effects reducing biodiversity nutrients may become concentrated in an anoxic zone and may only be made available again during autumn turn-over or in conditions of turbulent flow
enhanced growth of aquatic vegetation or phytoplankton and algal blooms disrupts normal functioning of the ecosystem causing a variety of problems such as a lack of oxygen needed for fish and shellfish to survive the water becomes cloudy typically coloured a shade of green yellow brown or red eutrophication also decreases the value of rivers lakes and aesthetic enjoyment health problems can occur where eutrophic conditions interfere with drinking water treatment
human activities can accelerate the rate at which nutrients enter ecosystems runoff from agriculture and development pollution from septic systems and sewers sewage sludge spreading and other human-related activities increase the flow of both inorganic nutrients and organic substances into ecosystems elevated levels of atmospheric compounds of nitrogen can increase nitrogen availability phosphorus is often regarded as the main culprit in cases of eutrophication in lakes subjected to "point source" pollution from sewage pipes the concentration of algae and the trophic state of lakes correspond well to phosphorus levels in water studies conducted in the experimental lakes area in ontario have shown a relationship between the addition of phosphorus and the rate of eutrophication humankind has increased the rate of phosphorus cycling on earth by four times mainly due to agricultural fertilizer production and application between 1950 and 1995 an estimated 600,000,000 tonnes of phosphorus were applied to earth's surface primarily on croplands policy changes to control point sources of phosphorus have resulted in rapid control of eutrophication
=== natural eutrophicationedit ===
although eutrophication is commonly caused by human activities it can also be a natural process particularly in lakes eutrophy occurs in many lakes in temperate grasslands for instance paleolimnologists now recognise that climate change geology and other external influences are critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes some lakes also demonstrate the reverse process (meiotrophication) becoming less nutrient rich with time the main difference between natural and anthropogenic eutrophication is that the natural process is very slow occurring on geological time scales
=== ocean watersedit ===
eutrophication is a common phenomenon in coastal waters in contrast to freshwater systems nitrogen is more commonly the key limiting nutrient of marine waters; thus nitrogen levels have greater importance to understanding eutrophication problems in salt water estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where run-off enters a confined channel upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep nutrient-rich waters to the surface where the nutrients can be assimilated by algae
the world resources institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones in the world concentrated in coastal areas in western europe the eastern and southern coasts of the us and east asia particularly japan
in addition to runoff from land atmospheric fixed nitrogen can enter the open ocean a study in 2008 found that this could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply and up to 3% of the annual new marine biological production it has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may prove as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
== terrestrial ecosystemsedit ==
terrestrial ecosystems are subject to similarly adverse impacts from eutrophication increased nitrates in soil are frequently undesirable for plants many terrestrial plant species are endangered as a result of soil eutrophication such as the majority of orchid species in europe meadows forests and bogs are characterized by low nutrient content and slowly growing species adapted to those levels so they can be overgrown by faster growing and more competitive species in meadows tall grasses that can take advantage of higher nitrogen levels may change the area so that natural species may be lost species-rich fens can be overtaken by reed or reedgrass species forest undergrowth affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a nettle and bramble thicket
chemical forms of nitrogen are most often of concern with regard to eutrophication because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth nitrogen is not readily available in soil because n2 a gaseous form of nitrogen is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert n2 into other forms such as nitrates however there is a limit to how much nitrogen can be utilized ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater coastal and marine eutrophication where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient this is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus however because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen consequently phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems
== ecological effectsedit ==
eutrophication was recognized as a water pollution problem in european and north american lakes and reservoirs in the mid-20th century since then it has become more widespread surveys showed that 54% of lakes in asia are eutrophic; in europe 53%; in north america 48%; in south america 41%; and in africa 28%
many ecological effects can arise from stimulating primary production but there are three particularly troubling ecological impacts: decreased biodiversity changes in species composition and dominance and toxicity effects
increased biomass of phytoplankton
toxic or inedible phytoplankton species
increases in blooms of gelatinous zooplankton
increased biomass of benthic and epiphytic algae
changes in macrophyte species composition and biomass
decreases in water transparency (increased turbidity)
colour smell and water treatment problems
dissolved oxygen depletion
increased incidences of fish kills
loss of desirable fish species
reductions in harvestable fish and shellfish
decreases in perceived aesthetic value of the water body
=== decreased biodiversityedit ===
when an ecosystem experiences an increase in nutrients primary producers reap the benefits first in aquatic ecosystems species such as algae experience a population increase (called an algal bloom) algal blooms limit the sunlight available to bottom-dwelling organisms and cause wide swings in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water oxygen is required by all aerobically respiring plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by photosynthesizing plants and algae under eutrophic conditions dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae when dissolved oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels fish and other marine animals suffocate as a result creatures such as fish shrimp and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off in extreme cases anaerobic conditions ensue promoting growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum that produces toxins deadly to birds and mammals zones where this occurs are known as dead zones
=== new species invasionedit ===
eutrophication may cause competitive release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient this process causes shifts in the species composition of ecosystems for instance an increase in nitrogen might allow new competitive species to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species this has been shown to occur in new england salt marshes in europe and asia the common carp frequently lives in naturally eutrophic or hypereutrophic areas and is adapted to living in such conditions the eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced
=== toxicityedit ===
some algal blooms otherwise called "nuisance algae" or "harmful algal blooms" are toxic to plants and animals toxic compounds they produce can make their way up the food chain resulting in animal mortality freshwater algal blooms can pose a threat to livestock when the algae die or are eaten neuro- and hepatotoxins are released which can kill animals and may pose a threat to humans an example of algal toxins working their way into humans is the case of shellfish poisoning biotoxins created during algal blooms are taken up by shellfish (mussels oysters) leading to these human foods acquiring the toxicity and poisoning humans examples include paralytic neurotoxic and diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning other marine animals can be vectors for such toxins as in the case of ciguatera where it is typically a predator fish that accumulates the toxin and then poisons humans
== sources of high nutrient runoffedit ==
in order to gauge how to best prevent eutrophication from occurring specific sources that contribute to nutrient loading must be identified there are two common sources of nutrients and organic matter: point and nonpoint sources
=== point sourcesedit ===
point sources are directly attributable to one influence in point sources the nutrient waste travels directly from source to water point sources are relatively easy to regulate
=== nonpoint sourcesedit ===
nonpoint source pollution (also known as 'diffuse' or 'runoff' pollution) is that which comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources nonpoint sources are difficult to regulate and usually vary spatially and temporally (with season precipitation and other irregular events)
it has been shown that nitrogen transport is correlated with various indices of human activity in watersheds including the amount of development ploughing in agriculture and development are activities that contribute most to nutrient loading there are three reasons that nonpoint sources are especially troublesome:
==== soil retentionedit ====
nutrients from human activities tend to accumulate in soils and remain there for years it has been shown that the amount of phosphorus lost to surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil thus much of the nutrient loading in soil eventually makes its way to water nitrogen similarly has a turnover time of decades
==== runoff to surface water and leaching to groundwateredit ====
nutrients from human activities tend to travel from land to either surface or ground water nitrogen in particular is removed through storm drains sewage pipes and other forms of surface runoff nutrient losses in runoff and leachate are often associated with agriculture modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to maximise production however farmers frequently apply more nutrients than are taken up by crops or pastures regulations aimed at minimising nutrient exports from agriculture are typically far less stringent than those placed on sewage treatment plants and other point source polluters it should be also noted that lakes within forested land are also under surface runoff influences runoff can wash out the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow natural eutrophication
==== atmospheric depositionedit ====
nitrogen is released into the air because of ammonia volatilization and nitrous oxide production the combustion of fossil fuels is a large human-initiated contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution atmospheric deposition (e.g. in the form of acid rain) can also affect nutrient concentration in water especially in highly industrialized regions
=== other causesedit ===
any factor that causes increased nutrient concentrations can potentially lead to eutrophication in modeling eutrophication the rate of water renewal plays a critical role; stagnant water is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies it has also been shown that the drying of wetlands causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms
== prevention and reversaledit ==
eutrophication poses a problem not only to ecosystems but to humans as well reducing eutrophication should be a key concern when considering future policy and a sustainable solution for everyone including farmers and ranchers seems feasible while eutrophication does pose problems humans should be aware that natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels cleanup measures have been mostly but not completely successful finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges these efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency still some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts
=== shellfish in estuaries: unique solutionsedit ===
one proposed solution to eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish populations such as oysters and mussels oyster reefs remove nitrogen from the water column and filter out suspended solids subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of harmful algal blooms or anoxic conditions filter feeding activity is considered beneficial to water quality by controlling phytoplankton density and sequestering nutrients which can be removed from the system through shellfish harvest buried in the sediments or lost through denitrification foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation was conducted by odd lindahl et al. using mussels in sweden in the united states shellfish restoration projects have been conducted on the east west and gulf coasts see nutrient pollution for an extended explanation of nutrient remediation using shellfish
=== minimizing nonpoint pollution: future workedit ===
nonpoint pollution is the most difficult source of nutrients to manage the literature suggests though that when these sources are controlled eutrophication decreases the following steps are recommended to minimize the amount of pollution that can enter aquatic ecosystems from ambiguous sources
==== riparian buffer zonesedit ====
studies show that intercepting non-point pollution between the source and the water is a successful means of prevention riparian buffer zones are interfaces between a flowing body of water and land and have been created near waterways in an attempt to filter pollutants; sediment and nutrients are deposited here instead of in water creating buffer zones near farms and roads is another possible way to prevent nutrients from traveling too far still studies have shown that the effects of atmospheric nitrogen pollution can reach far past the buffer zone this suggests that the most effective means of prevention is from the primary source
==== prevention policyedit ====
laws regulating the discharge and treatment of sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed in japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry thus it is not unreasonable to command livestock owners to clean up animal wastewhich when left stagnant will leach into ground water
policy concerning the prevention and reduction of eutrophication can be broken down into four sectors: technologies public participation economic instruments and cooperation the term technology is used loosely referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies as mentioned before nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed also through the efficient controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention because a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas particularly those in underdeveloped nations in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity the technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water both from domestic and industrial sources should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication
the role of the public is a major factor for the effective prevention of eutrophication in order for a policy to have any effect the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem and ways in which they can reduce their effects programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies
economic instruments "which include among others property rights water markets fiscal and financial instruments charge systems and liability systems are gradually becoming a substantive component of the management tool set used for pollution control and water allocation decisions." incentives for those who practice clean renewable water management technologies are an effective means of encouraging pollution prevention by internalizing the costs associated with the negative effects on the environment governments are able to encourage a cleaner water management
because a body of water can have an effect on a range of people reaching far beyond that of the watershed cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations going as low as the local population are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies in the united states the most well known inter-state effort to prevent eutrophication is the chesapeake bay
==== nitrogen testing and modelingedit ====
soil nitrogen testing (n-testing) is a technique that helps farmers optimize the amount of fertilizer applied to crops by testing fields with this method farmers saw a decrease in fertilizer application costs a decrease in nitrogen lost to surrounding sources or both by testing the soil and modeling the bare minimum amount of fertilizer needed farmers reap economic benefits while reducing pollution
==== organic farmingedit ====
there has been a study that found that organically fertilized fields "significantly reduce harmful nitrate leaching" over conventionally fertilized fields however a more recent study found that eutrophication impacts are in some cases higher from organic production than they are from conventional production
== cultural eutrophicationedit ==
cultural eutrophication is the process that speeds up natural eutrophication because of human activity due to clearing of land and building of towns and cities land runoff is accelerated and more nutrients such as phosphates and nitrate are supplied to lakes and rivers and then to coastal estuaries and bays extra nutrients are also supplied by treatment plants golf courses fertilizers and farms
these nutrients result in an excessive growth of plant life known as an algal bloom this can change a lake's natural food web and also reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water for organisms to breathe both these things cause animal and plant death rates to increase as the plants take in poisonous water while the animals drink the poisoned water this contaminates water making it undrinkable and sediment quickly fills the lake cultural eutrophication is a form of water pollution
cultural eutrophication also occurs when excessive fertilizers run into lakes and rivers this encourages the growth of algae (algal bloom) and other aquatic plants following this overcrowding occurs and plants compete for sunlight space and oxygen overgrowth of water plants also blocks sunlight and oxygen for aquatic life in the water which in turn threatens their survival algae also grows easily thus threatening other water plants no matter whether they are floating half-submerged or fully submerged not only does this cause algal blooming it can cause an array of more long-term effects on the water such as damage to coral reefs and deep sea animal life it also speeds up the damage of both marine and also affects humans if the effects of algal blooming is too drastic fish will die and there will be lack of food in the area nutrient pollution is a major cause of algal blooming and should be minimized
the experimental lakes area (ela) ontario canada is a fully equipped year-round permanent field station that uses the whole ecosystem approach and long-term whole-lake investigations of freshwater focusing on cultural eutrophication ela is currently cosponsored by the canadian departments of environment and fisheries and oceans with a mandate to investigate the aquatic effects of a wide variety of stresses on lakes and their catchments
