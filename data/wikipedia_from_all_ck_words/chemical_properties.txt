a chemical property is any of a material's properties that becomes evident during or after a chemical reaction that is any quality that can be established only by changing a substance's chemical identity simply speaking chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance the substance's internal structure must be affected greatly for its chemical properties to be investigated when a substance goes under a chemical reaction the properties will change drastically resulting in chemical change however a catalytic property would also be a chemical property
chemical properties can be contrasted with physical properties which can be discerned without changing the substance's structure however for many properties within the scope of physical chemistry and other disciplines at the boundary between chemistry and physics the distinction may be a matter of researcher's perspective material properties both physical and chemical can be viewed as supervenient i.e. secondary to the underlying reality several layers of superveniency are possible
chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications they can also be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances materials science will normally consider the chemical properties of a substance to guide its applications
