arno allan penzias (born 26 april 1933) is an american physicist radio astronomer and nobel laureate in physics who is co-discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation which helped establish the big bang theory of cosmology
== early life and educationedit ==
penzias was born in munich germany the son of justine (ne eisenreich) and karl penzias who ran a leather business at age six he was among the jewish children evacuated to britain as part of the kindertransport rescue operation some time later his parents also fled nazi germany for the u.s. and the family settled in the garment district of new york city in 1940 in 1946 penzias became a naturalized citizen of the united states he graduated from brooklyn technical high school in 1951 and after enrolling to study chemistry at the city college of new york he graduated in physics near the top of his class in 1954
following graduation penzias served for two years as a radar officer in the u.s army signal corps this led to a research assistantship in the columbia university radiation laboratory which was then heavily involved in microwave physics penzias worked under charles townes who later invented the maser in 1956 penzias enrolled as a student at columbia and by 1962 had been awarded a ph.d
== careeredit ==
he went on to work at bell labs in holmdel new jersey where with robert woodrow wilson he worked on ultra-sensitive cryogenic microwave receivers intended for radio astronomy observations in 1964 on building their most sensitive antenna/receiver system the pair encountered radio noise which they could not explain it was far less energetic than the radiation given off by the milky way and it was isotropic so they assumed their instrument was subject to interference by terrestrial sources they tried and then rejected the hypothesis that the radio noise emanated from new york city an examination of the microwave horn antenna showed it was full of pigeon droppings (which penzias described as white dielectric material") after the pair removed the dung buildup and the pigeons were shot (each physicist says the other ordered the deed) the noise remained having rejected all sources of interference penzias contacted robert dicke who suggested it might be the background radiation predicted by some cosmological theories the pair agreed with dicke to publish side-by-side letters in the astrophysical journal with penzias and wilson describing their observations and dicke suggesting the interpretation as the cosmic microwave background radiation (cmb) the radio remnant of the big bang this allowed astronomers to confirm the big bang and to correct many of their previous assumptions about it
he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1975 penzias and wilson received the 1978 nobel prize sharing it with pyotr leonidovich kapitsa (kapitsa's work was unrelated to penzias and wilson's) in 1977 the two had received the henry draper medal of the national academy of sciences penzias is also the recipient of the international center in new york's award of excellence in 1998 he was awarded the iri medal from the industrial research institute
penzias has been a resident of highland park new jersey he has a son david and two daughters mindy penzias dirks phd and rabbi shifra (laurie) weiss-penzias he currently serves as a venture partner at new enterprise associates
