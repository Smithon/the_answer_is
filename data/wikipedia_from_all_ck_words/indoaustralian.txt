in mathematics specifically in topology a surface is a two-dimensional topological manifold the most familiar examples are those that arise as the boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional euclidean space r3 such as a sphere on the other hand there are surfaces such as the klein bottle that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional euclidean space without introducing singularities or self-intersections
to say that a surface is two-dimensional means that about each point there is a coordinate patch on which a two-dimensional coordinate system is defined for example the surface of the earth is (ideally) a two-dimensional sphere and latitude and longitude provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the 180th meridian)
the concept of surface finds application in physics engineering computer graphics and many other disciplines primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects for example in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an airplane the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface
== definitions and first examples ==
a (topological) surface is a topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the euclidean plane e2 such a neighborhood together with the corresponding homeomorphism is known as a (coordinate) chart it is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the euclidean plane these coordinates are known as local coordinates and these homeomorphisms lead us to describe surfaces as being locally euclidean
in most writings on the subject it is often assumed explicitly or implicitly that as a topological space a surface is also nonempty second countable and hausdorff it is also often assumed that the surfaces under consideration are connected
the rest of this article will assume unless specified otherwise that a surface is nonempty hausdorff second countable and connected
more generally a (topological) surface with boundary is a hausdorff topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the closure of the upper half-plane h2 in c these homeomorphisms are also known as (coordinate) charts the boundary of the upper half-plane is the x-axis a point on the surface mapped via a chart to the x-axis is termed a boundary point the collection of such points is known as the boundary of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold that is the union of closed curves on the other hand a point mapped to above the x-axis is an interior point the collection of interior points is the interior of the surface which is always non-empty the closed disk is a simple example of a surface with boundary the boundary of the disc is a circle
the term surface used without qualification refers to surfaces without boundary in particular a surface with empty boundary is a surface in the usual sense a surface with empty boundary which is compact is known as a closed surface the two-dimensional sphere the two-dimensional torus and the real projective plane are examples of closed surfaces
the mbius strip is a surface on which the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise can be defined locally but not globally in general a surface is said to be orientable if it does not contain a homeomorphic copy of the mbius strip intuitively it has two distinct sides for example the sphere and torus are orientable while the real projective plane is not (because the real projective plane with one point removed is homeomorphic to the open mbius strip)
in differential and algebraic geometry extra structure is added upon the topology of the surface this added structures can be a smoothness structure (making it possible to define differentiable maps to and from the surface) a riemannian metric (making it possible to define length and angles on the surface) a complex structure (making it possible to define holomorphic maps to and from the surface in which case the surface is called a riemann surface) or an algebraic structure (making it possible to detect singularities such as self-intersections and cusps that cannot be described solely in terms of the underlying topology)
== extrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings ==
historically surfaces were initially defined as subspaces of euclidean spaces often these surfaces were the locus of zeros of certain functions usually polynomial functions such a definition considered the surface as part of a larger (euclidean) space and as such was termed extrinsic
in the previous section a surface is defined as a topological space with certain properties namely hausdorff and locally euclidean this topological space is not considered a subspace of another space in this sense the definition given above which is the definition that mathematicians use at present is intrinsic
a surface defined as intrinsic is not required to satisfy the added constraint of being a subspace of euclidean space it may seem possible for some surfaces defined intrinsically to not be surfaces in the extrinsic sense however the whitney embedding theorem asserts every surface can in fact be embedded homeomorphically into euclidean space in fact into e4 the extrinsic and intrinsic approaches turn out to be equivalent
in fact any compact surface that is either orientable or has a boundary can be embedded in e3 on the other hand the real projective plane which is compact non-orientable and without boundary cannot be embedded into e3 (see gramain) steiner surfaces including boy's surface the roman surface and the cross-cap are models of the real projective plane in e3 but only the boy surface is an immersed surface all these models are singular at points where they intersect themselves
the alexander horned sphere is a well-known pathological embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere
the chosen embedding (if any) of a surface into another space is regarded as extrinsic information it is not essential to the surface itself for example a torus can be embedded into e3 in the standard manner (which looks like a bagel) or in a knotted manner (see figure) the two embedded tori are homeomorphic but not isotopic they are topologically equivalent but their embeddings are not
the image of a continuous injective function from r2 to higher-dimensional rn is said to be a parametric surface such an image is so-called because the x- and y- directions of the domain r2 are 2 variables that parametrize the image a parametric surface need not be a topological surface a surface of revolution can be viewed as a special kind of parametric surface
if f is a smooth function from r3 to r whose gradient is nowhere zero then the locus of zeros of f does define a surface known as an implicit surface if the condition of non-vanishing gradient is dropped then the zero locus may develop singularities
== construction from polygons ==
each closed surface can be constructed from an oriented polygon with an even number of sides called a fundamental polygon of the surface by pairwise identification of its edges for example in each polygon below attaching the sides with matching labels (a with a b with b) so that the arrows point in the same direction yields the indicated surface
any fundamental polygon can be written symbolically as follows begin at any vertex and proceed around the perimeter of the polygon in either direction until returning to the starting vertex during this traversal record the label on each edge in order with an exponent of -1 if the edge points opposite to the direction of traversal the four models above when traversed clockwise starting at the upper left yield
sphere
real projective plane
torus
klein bottle 
note that the sphere and the projective plane can both be realized as quotients of the 2-gon while the torus and klein bottle require a 4-gon (square)
the expression thus derived from a fundamental polygon of a surface turns out to be the sole relation in a presentation of the fundamental group of the surface with the polygon edge labels as generators this is a consequence of the seifertvan kampen theorem
gluing edges of polygons is a special kind of quotient space process the quotient concept can be applied in greater generality to produce new or alternative constructions of surfaces for example the real projective plane can be obtained as the quotient of the sphere by identifying all pairs of opposite points on the sphere another example of a quotient is the connected sum
== connected sums ==
the connected sum of two surfaces m and n denoted m # n is obtained by removing a disk from each of them and gluing them along the boundary components that result the boundary of a disk is a circle so these boundary components are circles the euler characteristic of m # n is the sum of the euler characteristics of the summands minus two
the sphere s is an identity element for the connected sum meaning that s # m = m this is because deleting a disk from the sphere leaves a disk which simply replaces the disk deleted from m upon gluing
connected summation with the torus t is also described as attaching a handle to the other summand m if m is orientable then so is t # m the connected sum is associative so the connected sum of a finite collection of surfaces is well-defined
the connected sum of two real projective planes p # p is the klein bottle k the connected sum of the real projective plane and the klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus in a formula p # k = p # t thus the connected sum of three real projective planes is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus any connected sum involving a real projective plane is nonorientable
== closed surfaces ==
a closed surface is a surface that is compact and without boundary examples are spaces like the sphere the torus and the klein bottle examples of non-closed surfaces are an open disk which is a sphere with a puncture a cylinder which is a sphere with two punctures and the mbius strip
=== classification of closed surfaces ===
the classification theorem of closed surfaces states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families
the sphere
the connected sum of g tori for 
the connected sum of k real projective planes for 
the surfaces in the first two families are orientable it is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori the number g of tori involved is called the genus of the surface the sphere and the torus have euler characteristics 2 and 0 respectively and in general the euler characteristic of the connected sum of g tori is 2 2g
the surfaces in the third family are nonorientable the euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1 and in general the euler characteristic of the connected sum of k of them is 2 k
it follows that a closed surface is determined up to homeomorphism by two pieces of information its euler characteristic and whether it is orientable or not in other words euler characteristic and orientability completely classify closed surfaces up to homeomorphism
closed surfaces with multiple connected components are classified by the class of each of their connected components and thus one generally assumes that the surface is connected
=== monoid structure ===
relating this classification to connected sums the closed surfaces up to homeomorphism form a commutative monoid under the operation of connected sum as indeed do manifolds of any fixed dimension the identity is the sphere while the real projective plane and the torus generate this monoid with a single relation p # p # p = p # t which may also be written p # k = p # t since k = p # p this relation is sometimes known as dyck's theorem after walther von dyck who proved it in (dyck 1888) and the triple cross surface p # p # p is accordingly called dyck's surface
geometrically connect-sum with a torus (# t) adds a handle with both ends attached to the same side of the surface while connect-sum with a klein bottle (# k) adds a handle with the two ends attached to opposite sides of an orientable surface in the presence of a projective plane (# p) the surface is not orientable (there is no notion of side) so there is no difference between attaching a torus and attaching a klein bottle which explains the relation
=== surfaces with boundary ===
compact surfaces possibly with boundary are simply closed surfaces with a finite number of holes (open discs that have been removed) thus a connected compact surface is classified by the number of boundary components and the genus of the corresponding closed surface equivalently by the number of boundary components the orientability and euler characteristic the genus of a compact surface is defined as the genus of the corresponding closed surface
this classification follows almost immediately from the classification of closed surfaces removing an open disc from a closed surface yields a compact surface with a circle for boundary component and removing k open discs yields a compact surface with k disjoint circles for boundary components the precise locations of the holes are irrelevant because the homeomorphism group acts k-transitively on any connected manifold of dimension at least 2
conversely the boundary of a compact surface is a closed 1-manifold and is therefore the disjoint union of a finite number of circles filling these circles with disks (formally taking the cone) yields a closed surface
the unique compact orientable surface of genus g and with k boundary components is often denoted for example in the study of the mapping class group
=== riemann surfaces ===
a closely related example to the classification of compact 2-manifolds is the classification of compact riemann surfaces i.e. compact complex 1-manifolds (note that the 2-sphere and the torus are both complex manifolds in fact algebraic varieties.) since every complex manifold is orientable the connected sums of projective planes are not complex manifolds thus compact riemann surfaces are characterized topologically simply by their genus the genus counts the number of holes in the manifold the sphere has genus 0 the one-holed torus genus 1 etc
=== non-compact surfaces ===
non-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify as a simple example a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing (removing a finite set of points from) a closed manifold on the other hand any open subset of a compact surface is itself a non-compact surface consider for example the complement of a cantor set in the sphere otherwise known as the cantor tree surface however not every non-compact surface is a subset of a compact surface two canonical counterexamples are the jacob's ladder and the loch ness monster which are non-compact surfaces with infinite genus
a non-compact surface m has a non-empty space of ends e(m) which informally speaking describes the ways that the surface goes off to infinity the space e(m) is always topologically equivalent to a closed subspace of the cantor set m may have a finite or countably infinite number nh of handles as well as a finite or countably infinite number np of projective planes if both nh and np are finite then these two numbers and the topological type of space of ends classify the surface m up to topological equivalence if either or both of nh and np is infinite then the topological type of m depends not only on these two numbers but also on how the infinite one(s) approach the space of ends in general th topological type of m is determined by the four subspaces of e(m) that are limit points of infinitely many handles and infinitely many projective planes limit points of only handles limit points of only projective planes and limit points of neither
==== surfaces that are not even second countable ====
there exist (necessarily non-compact) topological surfaces having no countable base for their topology perhaps the simplest example is the cartesian product of the long line with the space of real numbers
another surface having no countable base for its topology but not requiring the axiom of choice to prove its existence is the prfer manifold which can be described by simple equations that show it to be a real-analytic surface the prfer manifold may be thought of as the upper half plane together with one additional tongue tx hanging down from it directly below the point (x,0) for each real x
in 1925 tibor rad proved the theorem that non-compact riemann surfaces (i.e. one-dimensional complex manifolds) are necessarily second countable by contrast the existence of the prfer surface shows that there exist two-dimensional complex manifolds (which are necessarily 4-dimensional real manifolds) with no countable base (this is because any n-real-dimensional real-analytic manifold q can be extended to an n-complex-dimensional complex manifold w that contains q as a real-analytic submanifold.)
=== proof ===
the classification of closed surfaces has been known since the 1860s and today a number of proofs exist
topological and combinatorial proofs in general rely on the difficult result that every compact 2-manifold is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex which is of interest in its own right the most common proof of the classification is (seifert & threlfall 1934) which brings every triangulated surface to a standard form a simplified proof which avoids a standard form was discovered by john h conway circa 1992 which he called the zero irrelevancy proof or zip proof and is presented in (francis & weeks 1999)
a geometric proof which yields a stronger geometric result is the uniformization theorem this was originally proven only for riemann surfaces in the 1880s and 1900s by felix klein paul koebe and henri poincar
== surfaces in geometry ==
polyhedra such as the boundary of a cube are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry it is also possible to define smooth surfaces in which each point has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to some open set in e this elaboration allows calculus to be applied to surfaces to prove many results
two smooth surfaces are diffeomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic (the analogous result does not hold for higher-dimensional manifolds.) thus closed surfaces are classified up to diffeomorphism by their euler characteristic and orientability
smooth surfaces equipped with riemannian metrics are of foundational importance in differential geometry a riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of geodesic distance angle and area it also gives rise to gaussian curvature which describes how curved or bent the surface is at each point curvature is a rigid geometric property in that it is not preserved by general diffeomorphisms of the surface however the famous gaussbonnet theorem for closed surfaces states that the integral of the gaussian curvature k over the entire surface s is determined by the euler characteristic
this result exemplifies the deep relationship between the geometry and topology of surfaces (and to a lesser extent higher-dimensional manifolds)
another way in which surfaces arise in geometry is by passing into the complex domain a complex one-manifold is a smooth oriented surface also called a riemann surface any complex nonsingular algebraic curve viewed as a complex manifold is a riemann surface
every closed orientable surface admits a complex structure complex structures on a closed oriented surface correspond to conformal equivalence classes of riemannian metrics on the surface one version of the uniformization theorem (due to poincar) states that any riemannian metric on an oriented closed surface is conformally equivalent to an essentially unique metric of constant curvature this provides a starting point for one of the approaches to teichmller theory which provides a finer classification of riemann surfaces than the topological one by euler characteristic alone
a complex surface is a complex two-manifold and thus a real four-manifold it is not a surface in the sense of this article neither are algebraic curves defined over fields other than the complex numbers nor are algebraic surfaces defined over fields other than the real numbers
