a gland is an organ in an animal's body that synthesizes a substance such as hormones for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland)
== structureedit ==
glands are organs that synthesizes a substance such as hormones for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland) numerous glands exist throughout the human body
=== developmentedit ===
every gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface this ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated
as growth proceeds the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots in which case a compound gland is formed in many glands the number of branches is limited in others (salivary pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division as a rule the branches do not unite with one another but in one instance the liver this does occur when a reticulated compound gland is produced in compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell
glands are classified according to their shape
if the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland
in the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size these are termed alveolar or saccular glands
== functionedit ==
glands are divided based on their function into two groups:
=== endocrine glandsedit ===
endocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the blood stream these glands that secrete their products through the basal lamina into the blood stream and lack a duct system these glands often secrete hormones and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis the pineal gland thymus gland pituitary gland thyroid gland and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands
=== exocrine glandsedit ===
exocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer surface of the body such as the skin or the human gastrointestinal tract secretion is directly onto the apical surface the glands in this group can be divided into three groups:
apocrine glands a portion of the secreting cell's body is lost during secretion apocrine gland is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion e.g mammery gland sweat gland of arm pit pubic region skin around anus lips nipples
holocrine glands the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances (e.g. sebaceous glands)sebaceous meibomiun & zeis gland
merocrine glands cells secrete their substances by exocytosis (e.g. mucous and serous glands) also called "eccrine" e.g max sweat gland of humans goblet cells salivary gland tear gland intestinal glands
the type of secretory product of exocrine glands may also be one of three categories:
serous glands secrete a watery fluid like often protein-rich product.e.g sweat gland
mucous glands secrete a viscous product rich in carbohydrates (e.g. glycoproteins).goblet cell
sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product these glands are also known as oil glands pancreas gastric gland
