binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts both of which use latin grammatical forms although they can be based on words from other languages such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just binomial") a binomen or a scientific name more informally it is also called a latin name the first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs the second part identifies the species within the genus for example humans belong to the genus homo and within this genus to the species homo sapiens the formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to swedish natural scientist carl linnaeus effectively beginning with his work species plantarum in 1753
the application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules of which the two most important are the international code of zoological nomenclature (iczn) for animals and the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants (icn) for plants although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes there are some differences both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules
in modern usage the first letter of the first part of the name the genus is always capitalized in writing while that of the second part is not even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place similarly both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist thomas drummond) is now written as phlox drummondii
in scientific works the authority for a binomial name is usually given at least when it is first mentioned and the date of publication may be specified
in zoology
patella vulgata linnaeus 1758 the name linnaeus tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of sea snail 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book systema naturae)
passer domesticus (linnaeus 1758) the original name given by linnaeus was fringilla domestica the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus the iczn does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given nor the date on which the change was made although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information
in botany
amaranthus retroflexus l. l. is the standard abbreviation used in botany for linnaeus
hyacinthoides italica (l.) rothm linnaeus first named this bluebell species scilla italica rothmaler transferred it to the genus hyacinthoides the icn does not require that the dates of either publication be specified
== historyedit ==
prior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature these names had two separate functions first to designate or label the species and second to be a diagnosis or description however these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible in a simple genus containing only two species it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name but as more species were discovered the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy for instance plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus spica cylindrica scapo tereti (plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves a cylindric spike and a terete scape) which we know today as plantago media
such polynomial names may sometimes look like binomials but are significantly different for example gerard's herbal (as amended by johnson) describes various kinds of spiderwort the first is called phalangium ramosum branched spiderwort the second phalangium non ramosum unbranched spiderwort the other  is aptly termed phalangium ephemerum virginianum soon-fading spiderwort of virginia the latin phrases are short descriptions rather than identifying labels
the bauhins in particular caspar bauhin (15601624) took some important steps towards the binomial system by pruning the latin descriptions in many cases to two words the adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to swedish botanist and physician carl von linn more commonly known by his latinized name carl linnaeus (17071778) it was in his 1753 species plantarum that he first began consistently using a one-word trivial name together with a generic name in a system of binomial nomenclature this trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet (icn) or specific name (iczn) the bauhins genus names were retained in many of these but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word
linnaeus's trivial names introduced an important new idea namely that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label this meant that the name no longer need be descriptive for example both parts could be derived from the names of people thus gerard's phalangium ephemerum virginianum became tradescantia virginiana where the genus name honoured john tradescant the younger an english botanist and gardener a bird in the parrot family was named psittacus alexandri meaning alexander's parrot after alexander the great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to greece linnaeus trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names and eventually replaced them
== valueedit ==
the value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy its widespread use and the uniqueness and stability of names it generally favors
economy compared to the polynomial system which it replaced a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember it corresponds to the widespread system of family name plus given name(s) used to name people in many cultures
widespread use the binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide a few binomials have also entered common speech such as homo sapiens e coli and tyrannosaurus rex
clarity binomial names avoid the confusion that can be created when attempting to use common names to refer to a species common names often differ from one country to another or even from one part of a country to another in english-speaking parts of europe the bird called a robin is erithacus rubecula in english-speaking north america a robin is turdus migratorius in contrast the scientific name can be used all over the world in all languages avoiding confusion and difficulties of translation
uniqueness provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species however establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can be difficult particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries therefore a species may have more than one regularly used name these names are synonyms
stability although stability is far from absolute the procedures associated with establishing binomial names such as the principle of priority tend to favor stability for example when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge) if possible the second part of the binomial is kept the same thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera chionodoxa and scilla are sufficiently different for them to be kept separate those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in europe the name chionodoxa siehei those who do not give it the name scilla siehei the siehei element is constant similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank such as subspecies where possible the second part of the binomial name is retained as the third part of the new name thus the tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the european robin in which case its name is erithacus superbus or as only a subspecies in which case its name is erithacus rubecula superbus the superbus element of the name is constant since taxonomists can legitimately disagree as to whether two genera or two species are distinct or not more than one name can be in use the only reason a specific epithet may need to be changed is if that by transferring it to a new genus it becomes a junior homonym of an older specific epithet for a different species in the same genus
== problemsedit ==
binomial nomenclature for species has the effect that when a species is moved from one genus to another not only is its genus name changed but sometimes its species name must be changed as well (e.g because the name is already used in the new genus or to agree in gender with the new genus) some biologists have argued for the combination of the genus name and specific epithet into a single unambiguous name or for the use of uninomials (as used in nomenclature of ranks above species)
== relationship to classification and taxonomyedit ==
nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification although the two are related classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities and/or differences in biological classification species are one of the kinds of item to be classified in principle the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification this is not the case for binomial names since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed above the rank of genus binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent for example a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus the independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera
taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification its first stages (sometimes called alpha taxonomy") are concerned with finding describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named taxonomists are also concerned with classification including its principles procedures and rules
== derivation of binomial namesedit ==
a complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the latin language (hence the common use of the term latin name for a binomial name) however the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources of which latin is only one these include
latin either classical or medieval thus both parts of the binomial name homo sapiens are latin words meaning wise (sapiens) human/man (homo)
classical greek the genus rhododendron was named by linnaeus from the greek word  itself derived from rhodos rose and dendron tree greek words are often converted to a latinized form thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name erythroxylum coca erythroxylum is derived from the greek words erythros red and xylon wood the greek neuter ending - (-on) is often converted to the latin neuter ending -um
other languages the second part of the name erythroxylum coca is derived from kuka the name of the plant in aymara and quechua since many dinosaur fossils were found in mongolia their names often use mongolian words e.g tarchia from tarkhi meaning brain or saichania meaning beautiful one
names of people (often naturalists or biologists) the name magnolia campbellii commemorates two people pierre magnol a french botanist and archibald campbell a doctor in british india
names of places the lone star tick amblyomma americanum is widespread in the united states
other sources some binominal names have been constructed from anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names thus the name of the genus muilla is derived by reversing the name allium names may also be derived from jokes or puns for example ratcliffe described a number of species of rhinoceros beetle including cyclocephala nodanotherwon
the first part of the name which identifies the genus must be a word which can be treated as a latin singular noun in the nominative case it must be unique within each kingdom but can be repeated between kingdoms thus huia recurvata is an extinct species of plant found as fossils in yunnan china whereas huia masonii is a species of frog found in java indonesia
the second part of the name which identifies the species within the genus is also treated grammatically as a latin word it can have one of a number of forms
the second part of a binomial may be an adjective the adjective must agree with the genus name in gender latin has three genders masculine feminine and neuter shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives the house sparrow has the binomial name passer domesticus here domesticus ("domestic") simply means associated with the house the sacred bamboo is nandina domestica rather than nandina domesticus since nandina is feminine whereas passer is masculine the tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant lansium parasiticum since lansium is neuter some common endings for latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine feminine neuter) are -us -a -um (as in the previous example of domesticus) -is -is -e (e.g tristis meaning sad") and -or -or -us (e.g minor meaning smaller") for further information see latin declension adjectives
the second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case an example is the binomial name of the lion which is panthera leo grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender in this case panthera is feminine and leo is masculine
the second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case the genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in latin depending on the declension of the noun common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural the noun may be part of a person's name often the surname as in the tibetan antelope pantholops hodgsonii the shrub magnolia hodgsonii or the olive-backed pipit anthus hodgsoni the meaning is of the person named so that magnolia hodgsonii means hodgson's magnolia the -ii or -i endings show that in each case hodgson was a man (not the same one) had hodgson been a woman hodgsonae would have been used the person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name for example anthus hodgsoni was named by charles wallace richmond in honour of hodgson rather than a person the noun may be related to a place as with latimeria chalumnae meaning of the chalumna river another use of genitive nouns is in for example the name of the bacterium escherichia coli where coli means of the colon this formation is common in parasites as in xenos vesparum where vesparum means of the wasps since xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps
whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above) the full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom
== codesedit ==
from the early 19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names in the course of time these became nomenclature codes the international code of zoological nomenclature (iczn) governs the naming of animals the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants (icn) that of plants (including cyanobacteria) and the international code of nomenclature of bacteria (icnb) that of bacteria (including archaea) virus names are governed by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv) a taxonomic code which determines taxa as well as names these codes differ in certain ways e.g.
binomial nomenclature is the correct term for botany although it is also used by zoologists since 1953 binominal nomenclature is the technically correct term in zoology a binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina)
both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the genus name in zoological code (iczn) the second part of the name is a specific name or in the botanical code (icn) a specific epithet together these two parts are referred to as a species name or binomen in the zoological code or species name binomial or binary combination in the botanical code
the icn the plant code does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym) whereas the iczn the animal code does thus the american bison has the binomial bison bison a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant
the starting points the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively) vary from group to group in botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year carl linnaeus first published species plantarum) in zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 january 1758 is considered the date of the publication of linnaeus's systema naturae 10th edition and also clerck's aranei svecici) bacteriology started anew with a starting point on 1 january 1980
unifying the different codes into a single code the biocode has been suggested although implementation is not in sight (there is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks but instead names clades this is called the phylocode.)
== writing binomial namesedit ==
by tradition the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics for example homo sapiens generally the binomial should be printed in a font style different from that used in the normal text for example several more homo sapiens fossils were discovered. when handwritten each part of a binomial name should be underlined for example homo sapiens
the first part of the binomial the genus name is always written with an initial capital letter in current usage the second part is never written with an initial capital older sources particularly botanical works published before the 1950s use a different convention if the second part of the name is derived from a proper noun e.g the name of a person or place a capital letter was used thus the modern form berberis darwinii was written as berberis darwinii a capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition e.g panthera leo or centaurea cyanus
when used with a common name the scientific name often follows in parentheses although this varies with publication for example the house sparrow (passer domesticus) is decreasing in europe.
the binomial name should generally be written in full the exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report or the same species is mentioned repeatedly in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop) for example a list of members of the genus canis might be written as canis lupus c aureus c simensis in rare cases this abbreviated form has spread to more general use for example the bacterium escherichia coli is often referred to as just e coli and tyrannosaurus rex is perhaps even better known simply as t rex these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given
the abbreviation sp. is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified the abbreviation spp. (plural) indicates several species these abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined) for example canis sp. means an unspecified species of the genus canis while canis spp. means two or more species of the genus canis (the abbreviations sp. and spp. can easily be confused with the abbreviations ssp. (zoology) or subsp. (botany) plurals sspp. or subspp. referring to one or more subspecies see trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name.)
the abbreviation cf. (i.e confer in latin) is used to compare individuals/taxa with known/described species conventions for use of the cf. qualifier vary in paleontology it is typically used when the identification is not confirmed for example corvus cf nasicus was used to indicate a fossil bird similar to the cuban crow but not certainly identified as this species in molecular systematics papers cf. may be used to indicate one or more undescribed species assumed related to a described species for example in a paper describing the phylogeny of small benthic freshwater fish called darters five undescribed putative species (ozark sheltowee wildcat ihiyo and mamequit darters) notable for brightly colored nuptial males with distinctive color patterns were referred to as etheostoma cf spectabile because they had been viewed as related to but distinct from etheostoma spectabile (orangethroat darter) this view was supported in varying degrees by dna analysis the somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as open nomenclature and it is not subject to strict usage codes
in some contexts the dagger symbol ("") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct
=== authorityedit ===
in scholarly texts at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the authority a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name the authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany for names governed by the iczn the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication the iczn recommends that the original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name. for names governed by the icn the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted the international plant names index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations historically abbreviations were used in zoology too
when the original name is changed e.g the species is moved to a different genus both codes use parentheses around the original authority the icn also requires the person who made the change to be given some examples
(plant) amaranthus retroflexus l l. is the standard abbreviation for linnaeus the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name
(plant) hyacinthoides italica (l.) rothm linnaeus first named the italian bluebell scilla italica rothmaler transferred it to the genus hyacinthoides
(animal) passer domesticus (linnaeus 1758) the original name given by linnaeus was fringilla domestica unlike the icn the iczn does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given
== other ranksedit ==
binomial nomenclature as described here is a system for naming species implicitly it includes a system for naming genera since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name in a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species ranks above genus (e.g. family order class) receive one-part names which are conventionally not written in italics thus the house sparrow passer domesticus belongs to the family passeridae family names are normally based on genus names although the endings used differ between zoology and botany
ranks below species receive three-part names conventionally written in italics like the names of species there are significant differences between the iczn and the icn in zoology the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen) thus one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is anthus hodgsoni berezowskii in botany there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts a connecting term (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank thus the american black elder is sambucus nigra subsp canadensis the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is cyclamen hederifolium f albiflorum
