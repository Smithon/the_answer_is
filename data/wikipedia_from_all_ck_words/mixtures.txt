in chemistry a mixture is a material system made up of two or more different substances which are mixed but are not combined chemically a mixture refers to the physical combination of two or more substances on which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions suspensions and colloids
mixtures are the one product of a mechanical blending or mixing of chemical substances like elements and compounds without chemical bonding or other chemical change so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup despite that there are no chemical changes to its constituents the physical properties of a mixture such as its melting point may differ from those of the components some mixtures can be separated into their components by physical (mechanical or thermal) means azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually pose considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or even a blend of them)
== kinds of mixtures ==
mixtures can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous a homogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the composition is uniform and every part of the solution has the same properties a heterogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the components can be seen as there are two or more phases present one example of a mixture is air air is a homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen oxygen and smaller amounts of other substances salt sugar and many other substances dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures a homogeneous mixture in which there is both a solute and solvent present is also a solution mixtures can have any amounts of ingredients
the following table shows the main properties of the three families of mixtures
the following table shows examples of the three types of mixtures
== physics and chemistry ==
a heterogeneous mixture is a mixture of two or more chemical substances (elements or compounds) examples are mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings a conglomerate rock water and oil a portion salad trail mix and concrete (not cement) a mixture of powdered silver metal and powdered gold metal would represent a heterogeneous mixture of two elements
making a distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures is a matter of the scale of sampling on a coarse enough scale any mixture can be said to be homogeneous if you'll allow the entire article to count as a sample of it on a fine enough scale any mixture can be said to be heterogeneous because a sample could be as small as a single molecule in practical terms if the property of interest of the mixture is the same regardless of which sample of it is taken for the examination used the mixture is homogeneous
gy's sampling theory quantitavely defines the heterogeneity of a particle as
where     and are respectively the heterogeneity of the th particle of the population the mass concentration of the property of interest in the th particle of the population the mass concentration of the property of interest in the population the mass of the th particle in the population and the average mass of a particle in the population
during sampling of heterogeneous mixtures of particles the variance of the sampling error is generally non-zero
pierre gy derived from the poisson sampling model the following formula for the variance of the sampling error in the mass concentration in a sample
in which v is the variance of the sampling error n is the number of particles in the population (before the sample was taken) q i is the probability of including the ith particle of the population in the sample (i.e the first-order inclusion probability of the ith particle) m i is the mass of the ith particle of the population and a i is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the ith particle of the population
the above equation for the variance of the sampling error is an approximation based on a linearization of the mass concentration in a sample
in the theory of gy correct sampling is defined as a sampling scenario in which all particles have the same probability of being included in the sample this implies that q i no longer depends on i and can therefore be replaced by the symbol q gy's equation for the variance of the sampling error becomes
where abatch is that concentration of the property of interest in the population from which the sample is to be drawn and mbatch is the mass of the population from which the sample is to be drawn
