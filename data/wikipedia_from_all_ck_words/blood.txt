blood is a bodily fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells when it reaches the lungs gas exchange occurs when carbon dioxide is diffused out of the blood into the pulmonary alveoli and oxygen is diffused into the blood this oxygenated blood is pumped to the left hand side of the heart in the pulmonary vein and enters the left atrium from here it passes through the mitral valve through the ventricle and taken all around the body by the aorta blood contains antibodies nutrients oxygen and much more to help the body work
in vertebrates it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma plasma which constitutes 55% of blood fluid is mostly water (92% by volume) and contains dissipated proteins glucose mineral ions hormones carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and blood cells themselves albumin is the main protein in plasma and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood the blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called rbcs or erythrocytes) white blood cells (also called wbcs or leukocytes) and platelets the most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells these contain hemoglobin an iron-containing protein which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood in contrast carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion
vertebrate blood is bright red when its haemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated some animals such as crustaceans and mollusks use hemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of hemoglobin insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system in most insects this blood does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen
jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system based largely on white blood cells white blood cells help to resist infections and parasites platelets are important in the clotting of blood arthropods using hemolymph have hemocytes as part of their immune system
blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart in animals with lungs arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body and venous blood carries carbon dioxide a waste product of metabolism produced by cells from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled
medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the greek word (haima) for blood in terms of anatomy and histology blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen
== functions ==
blood performs many important functions within the body including
supply of oxygen to tissues (bound to hemoglobin which is carried in red cells)
supply of nutrients such as glucose amino acids and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins (e.g. blood lipids))
removal of waste such as carbon dioxide urea and lactic acid
immunological functions including circulation of white blood cells and detection of foreign material by antibodies
coagulation the response to a broken blood vessel the conversion of blood from a liquid to a semi-solid gel to stop bleeding
messenger functions including the transport of hormones and the signaling of tissue damage
regulation of body ph
regulation of core body temperature
hydraulic functions
== constituents ==
blood accounts for 7% of the human body weight with an average density of approximately 1060 kg/m3 very close to pure water's density of 1000 kg/m3 the average adult has a blood volume of roughly 5 litres (11 us pt) which is composed of plasma and several kinds of cells these blood cells (which are also called corpuscles or formed elements") consist of erythrocytes (red blood cells rbcs) leukocytes (white blood cells) and thrombocytes (platelets) by volume the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood the plasma about 54.3% and white cells about 0.7%
whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits non-newtonian fluid dynamics its flow properties are adapted to flow effectively through tiny capillary blood vessels with less resistance than plasma by itself in addition if all human hemoglobin were free in the plasma rather than being contained in rbcs the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively
=== cells ===
one microliter of blood contains
4.7 to 6.1 million (male) 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) erythrocytes red blood cells contain the blood's hemoglobin and distribute oxygen mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and organelles in mammals the red blood cells (together with endothelial vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by glycoproteins that define the different blood types the proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the hematocrit and is normally about 45% the combined surface area of all red blood cells of the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface
4,00011,000 leukocytes white blood cells are part of the body's immune system they destroy and remove old or aberrant cells and cellular debris as well as attack infectious agents (pathogens) and foreign substances the cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia
200,000500,000 thrombocytes also called platelets they take part in blood clotting (coagulation) fibrin from the coagulation cascade creates a mesh over the platelet plug
=== plasma ===
about 55% of blood is blood plasma a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium which by itself is straw-yellow in color the blood plasma volume totals of 2.73.0 liters (2.83.2 quarts) in an average human it is essentially an aqueous solution containing 92% water 8% blood plasma proteins and trace amounts of other materials plasma circulates dissolved nutrients such as glucose amino acids and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins) and removes waste products such as carbon dioxide urea and lactic acid
other important components include
serum albumin
blood-clotting factors (to facilitate coagulation)
immunoglobulins (antibodies)
lipoprotein particles
various other proteins
various electrolytes (mainly sodium and chloride)
the term serum refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed most of the proteins remaining are albumin and immunoglobulins
=== ph values ===
blood ph is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45 making it slightly basic blood that has a ph below 7.35 is too acidic whereas blood ph above 7.45 is too basic blood ph partial pressure of oxygen (po2) partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pco2) and hco3 are carefully regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms which exert their influence principally through the respiratory system and the urinary system in order to control the acid-base balance and respiration an arterial blood gas test will measure these plasma also circulates hormones transmitting their messages to various tissues the list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is extensive
=== blood in non-mammalian vertebrates ===
human blood is typical of that of mammals although the precise details concerning cell numbers size protein structure and so on vary somewhat between species in non-mammalian vertebrates however there are some key differences
red blood cells of non-mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form and retain their cell nuclei
there is considerable variation in the types and proportions of white blood cells for example acidophils are generally more common than in humans
platelets are unique to mammals in other vertebrates small nucleated spindle cells called thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting instead
== physiology ==
=== cardiovascular system ===
blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart in humans blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins it then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body and venous blood carries carbon dioxide a waste product of metabolism by cells to the lungs to be exhaled however one exception includes pulmonary arteries which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood
additional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium
the blood circulation was famously described by william harvey in 1628
=== production and degradation of blood cells ===
in vertebrates the various cells of blood are made in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis which includes erythropoiesis the production of red blood cells and myelopoiesis the production of white blood cells and platelets during childhood almost every human bone produces red blood cells as adults red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones the bodies of the vertebrae the breastbone (sternum) the ribcage the pelvic bones and the bones of the upper arms and legs in addition during childhood the thymus gland found in the mediastinum is an important source of t lymphocytes the proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the liver while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney
healthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the spleen and the kupffer cells in the liver the liver also clears some proteins lipids and amino acids the kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine
=== oxygen transport ===
about 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the hgb about 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hgb the hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for exceptions see below) hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of between 1.36 and 1.37 ml o2 per gram hemoglobin which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml o2 per liter blood per mm hg partial pressure of oxygen (approximately 100 mm hg in arteries)
with the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries where the oxygen is consumed afterwards venules and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart
under normal conditions in adult humans at rest hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 9899% saturated with oxygen achieving an oxygen delivery of between 950 and 1150 ml/min to the body in a healthy adult at rest oxygen consumption is approximately 200 - 250 ml/min and deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75% (70 to 78%) saturated increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance during surgery under anesthesia) sustained hypoxia (oxygenation of less than 90%) is dangerous to health and severe hypoxia (saturations of less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal
a fetus receiving oxygen via the placenta is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs) and so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin f) in order to function under these conditions
=== carbon dioxide transport ===
co2 is carried in blood in three different ways (the exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood) most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions hco
3 by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction co2 + h2o h2co3 h+ + hco
3 about 7% is dissolved in the plasma and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds hemoglobin the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide however the co2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen instead it combines with the n-terminal groups on the four globin chains however because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule the binding of co2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen the decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the haldane effect and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs a rise in the partial pressure of co2 or a lower ph will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin which is known as the bohr effect
=== transport of hydrogen ions ===
some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin
=== lymphatic system ===
in mammals blood is in equilibrium with lymph which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the thoracic duct which drains into the left subclavian vein where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation
=== thermoregulation ===
blood circulation transports heat throughout the body and adjustments to this flow are an important part of thermoregulation increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g. during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin resulting in faster heat loss in contrast when the external temperature is low blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body preferentially
=== hydraulic functions ===
the restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement resulting in an erection of that tissue examples are the erectile tissue in the penis and clitoris
another example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump without the need for bulky muscular legs
=== invertebrates ===
in insects the blood (more properly called hemolymph) is not involved in the transport of oxygen (openings called tracheae allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues) insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system
other invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature hemocyanin (blue) contains copper and is found in crustaceans and mollusks it is thought that tunicates (sea squirts) might use vanabins (proteins containing vanadium) for respiratory pigment (bright-green blue or orange)
in many invertebrates these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys
giant tube worms have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments these hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals
== color ==
the coloring matter of blood (hemochrome) is largely due to the protein in the blood responsible for oxygen transport different groups of organisms use different proteins
=== hemoglobin ===
hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates each molecule has four heme groups and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color in vertebrates and other hemoglobin-using creatures arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red this is present in veins and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken this is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states
blood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red because carbon monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin in cyanide poisoning the body cannot utilize oxygen so the venous blood remains oxygenated increasing the redness there are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear bluea symptom called cyanosis if the heme is oxidized methaemoglobin which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen is formed in the rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated and appears dark red with a bluish hue
veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons however the factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex rather than the actual color of the venous blood
skinks in the genus prasinohaema have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin
=== hemocyanin ===
the blood of most mollusks including cephalopods and gastropods as well as some arthropods such as horseshoe crabs is blue as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated the blood in the circulation of these creatures which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions is grey-white to pale yellow and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air as seen when they bleed this is due to change in color of hemocyanin when it is oxidized hemocyanin carries oxygen in extracellular fluid which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in rbcs
=== chlorocruorin ===
the blood of most annelid worms and some marine polychaetes use chlorocruorin to transport oxygen it is green in color in dilute solutions
=== hemerythrin ===
hemerythrin is used for oxygen transport in the marine invertebrates sipunculids priapulids brachiopods and the annelid worm magelona hemerythrin is violet-pink when oxygenated
=== hemovanadin ===
the blood of some species of ascidians and tunicates also known as sea squirts contains proteins called vanabins these proteins are based on vanadium and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water unlike hemocyanin and hemoglobin hemovanadin is not an oxygen carrier when exposed to oxygen however vanabins turn a mustard yellow
== pathology ==
=== general medical disorders ===
disorders of volume
injury can cause blood loss through bleeding a healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1 l) before the first symptom restlessness begins and 40% of volume (2 l) before shock sets in thrombocytes are important for blood coagulation and the formation of blood clots which can stop bleeding trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause internal bleeding which can sometimes be severe
dehydration can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood this would rarely result in shock (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in orthostatic hypotension and fainting
disorders of circulation
shock is the ineffective perfusion of tissues and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss infection poor cardiac output
atherosclerosis reduces the flow of blood through arteries because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them atheroma tends to increase with age and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking high blood pressure excess circulating lipids (hyperlipidemia) and diabetes mellitus
coagulation can form a thrombosis which can obstruct vessels
problems with blood composition the pumping action of the heart or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied the term ischemia refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood and infarction refers to tissue death (necrosis) which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate)
=== hematological disorders ===
anemia
insufficient red cell mass (anemia) can be the result of bleeding blood disorders like thalassemia or nutritional deficiencies and may require blood transfusion several countries have blood banks to fill the demand for transfusable blood a person receiving a blood transfusion must have a blood type compatible with that of the donor
sickle-cell anemia
disorders of cell proliferation
leukemia is a group of cancers of the blood-forming tissues and cells
non-cancerous overproduction of red cells (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential thrombocytosis) may be premalignant
myelodysplastic syndromes involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines
disorders of coagulation
hemophilia is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's clotting mechanisms this can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening but more commonly results in hemarthrosis or bleeding into joint spaces which can be crippling
ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders)
hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function and can cause thrombosis
infectious disorders of blood
blood is an important vector of infection hiv the virus that causes aids is transmitted through contact with blood semen or other body secretions of an infected person hepatitis b and c are transmitted primarily through blood contact owing to blood-borne infections bloodstained objects are treated as a biohazard
bacterial infection of the blood is bacteremia or sepsis viral infection is viremia malaria and trypanosomiasis are blood-borne parasitic infections
=== carbon monoxide poisoning ===
substances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body carbon monoxide for example is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood this can cause suffocation insidiously a fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco
== medical treatments ==
=== blood products ===
blood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a blood bank there are many different blood types in humans the abo blood group system and the rhesus blood group system being the most important transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe often fatal complications so crossmatching is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused
other blood products administered intravenously are platelets blood plasma cryoprecipitate and specific coagulation factor concentrates
=== intravenous administration ===
many forms of medication (from antibiotics to chemotherapy) are administered intravenously as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract
after severe acute blood loss liquid preparations generically known as plasma expanders can be given intravenously either solutions of salts (nacl kcl cacl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations or colloidal solutions such as dextrans human serum albumin or fresh frozen plasma in these emergency situations a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion
=== bloodletting ===
in modern evidence-based medicine bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases including hemochromatosis and polycythemia however bloodletting and leeching were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood according to hippocratic medicine
== history ==
according to the oxford english dictionary the word blood dates to the oldest english circa 1000 ad the word is derived from middle english which is derived from the old english word bld which is akin to the old high german word bluot meaning blood the modern german word is (das) blut
=== classical greek medicine ===
fhrus (a swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) suggested that the ancient greek system of humorism wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments) were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container when blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour four different layers can be seen a dark clot forms at the bottom (the black bile") above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the blood") above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the phlegm") the top layer is clear yellow serum (the yellow bile")
=== human blood ===
the abo blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by karl landsteiner jan jansk is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (a b ab o) in 1907 which remains in use today in 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the abo system to predict compatibility the first non-direct transfusion was performed on march 27 1914 the rhesus factor was discovered in 1937
== cultural and religious beliefs ==
due to its importance to life blood is associated with a large number of beliefs one of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage to be related by blood is to be related by ancestry or descendance rather than marriage this bears closely to bloodlines and sayings such as blood is thicker than water and bad blood as well as blood brother
blood is given particular emphasis in the jewish and christian religions because leviticus 17:11 says the life of a creature is in the blood. this phrase is part of the levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off
mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood seen in such events as childbirth as contrasted with the blood of injury or death
=== indigenous australians ===
in many indigenous australian aboriginal peoples traditions ochre (particularly red) and blood both high in iron content and considered maban are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual as lawlor states
in many aboriginal rituals and ceremonies red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers in secret sacred male ceremonies blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive
lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the dreamtime lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and magnetic fields because iron is magnetic
=== european paganism ===
among the germanic tribes blood was used during their sacrifices the blts the blood was considered to have the power of its originator and after the butchering the blood was sprinkled on the walls on the statues of the gods and on the participants themselves this act of sprinkling blood was called bledsian in old english and the terminology was borrowed by the roman catholic church becoming to bless and blessing the hittite word for blood ishar was a cognate to words for oath and bond see ishara the ancient greeks believed that the blood of the gods ichor was a substance that was poisonous to mortals
as a relic of germanic law the cruentation an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer was used until the early 17th century
=== christianity ===
in genesis 9:4 god prohibited noah and his sons from eating blood (see noahide law) this command continued to be observed by the eastern orthodox
it is also found in the bible that when the angel of death came around to the hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway
at the council of jerusalem the apostles prohibited certain christians from consuming bloodthis is documented in acts 15:20 and 29 this chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19-21) it was to avoid offending jews who had become christians because the mosaic law code prohibited the practice
christ's blood is the means for the atonement of sins also the blood of jesus christ his [god] son cleanseth us from all sin. (1 john 1:7) unto him [god] that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. (revelation 1:5) and and they overcame him (satan) by the blood of the lamb [jesus the christ] and by the word of their testimony (revelation 12:11)
some christian churches including roman catholicism eastern orthodoxy oriental orthodoxy and the assyrian church of the east teach that when consecrated the eucharistic wine actually becomes the blood of jesus for worshippers to drink thus in the consecrated wine jesus becomes spiritually and physically present this teaching is rooted in the last supper as written in the four gospels of the bible in which jesus stated to his disciples that the bread that they ate was his body and the wine was his blood this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you. (luke 22:20)
most forms of protestantism especially those of a wesleyan or presbyterian lineage teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of christ who is spiritually but not physically present lutheran theology teaches that the body and blood is present together in with and under the bread and wine of the eucharistic feast
=== judaism ===
in judaism animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere) this is reflected in jewish dietary laws (kashrut) blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots) salting and then rinsing with water again several times eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption although blood from fish is biblically kosher it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the biblical prohibition
another ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of fowl and game after slaughtering (leviticus 17:13) the reason given by the torah is because the life of the animal is [in] its blood (ibid 17:14) in relation to human beings kabbalah expounds on this verse that the animal soul of a person is in the blood and that physical desires stem from it
likewise the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person by removing the animal's blood the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed making the meat fit for human consumption
=== islam ===
consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by islamic dietary laws this is derived from the statement in the qur'an sura al-ma'ida (5:3) forbidden to you (for food) are dead meat blood the flesh of swine and that on which has been invoked the name of other than allah.
blood is considered unclean hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred specific rules and prohibitions apply to menstruation postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding when an animal has been slaughtered the animal's neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen in this way blood is removed from the body and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat in modern times blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules
=== jehovah's witnesses ===
based on their interpretation of scriptures such as acts 15:28 29 ("keep abstaining...from blood.") jehovah's witnesses neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components red blood cells white blood cells platelets (thrombocytes) and plasma members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components
=== east asian culture ===
in south east asian popular culture it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood he is experiencing sexual desire this often appears in chinese-language and hong kong films as well as in japanese and korean culture parodied in anime manga and drama characters mostly males will often be shown with a nosebleed if they have just seen someone nude or in little clothing or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused
=== vampire legends ===
vampires are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance usually with a preference for human blood cultures all over the world have myths of this kind for example the nosferatu legend a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others originates from eastern european folklore ticks leeches female mosquitoes vampire bats and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals but only bats are associated with vampires this has no relation to vampire bats which are new world creatures discovered well after the origins of the european myths
== applications ==
=== in the applied sciences ===
blood residue can help forensic investigators identify weapons reconstruct a criminal action and link suspects to the crime through bloodstain pattern analysis forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains
blood residue analysis is also a technique used in archeology
=== in art ===
blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art in particular the performances of viennese actionist hermann nitsch istvan kantor franko b lennie lee ron athey yang zhichao lucas abela and kira o reilly along with the photography of andres serrano have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element marc quinn has made sculptures using frozen blood including a cast of his own head made using his own blood
=== in genealogy and family history ===
the term blood is used in genealogical circles to refer to one's ancestry origins and ethnic background as in the word bloodline other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are blue-blood royal blood mixed-blood and blood relative
