solenoid protein domains highly modular type protein domains consist chain nearly identical folds often simply called repeats extremely common among types proteins though exact figures unknown
repeats molecular biology
proteins repeat sequence block returns one time sequence either identical highly similar form repetitiveness indicate anything structure protein rule thumb short repetitive sequences eg length amino acids may intrinsically disordered part folded protein domains repeats least amino acids long far likely folded part domain long repeats frequently indicative presence solenoid domain protein
examples disordered repetitive sequences include mer peptide repeats found rpb subunit rna polymerase ii tandem betacatenin axin binding linear motifs apc adenomatous polyposis coli examples short repeats exhibiting ordered structures include threeresidue collagen repeat fiveresidue pentapeptide repeat forms beta helix structure
architecture solenoid domains
due identical form building blocks solenoid domains assume limited number shapes two main topologies possible linear open generally degree helical curvature circular closed
linear open solenoids
two terminal repeats solenoid physically interact leads open linear structure members group frequently rod crescentshaped number individual repeats range clear advantage topology n cterminal ends free add new repeats folds even remove existing ones evolution without gross impact structural stability entire domain type domain extremely common among extracellular segments receptors cell adhesion molecules nonexhaustive list examples include egf repeats cadherin repeats leucinerich repeats heat repeats ankyrin repeats armadillo repeats tetratricopeptide repeats etc whenever linear solenoid domain structure participates proteinprotein interactions frequently least repetitive subunits form ligandbinding sites thus individual repeats might limited ability fold usually cannot perform functions entire domain alone
circular closed solenoids
case n cterminal repeats lie close physical contact solenoid domain result topologically compact closed structure domains typically display high rotational symmetry unlike open solenoinds translational symmetries assume wheellike shape limitations structure number individual repeats arbitrary case wd repeats perhaps largest family closed solenoids number repeats range usually kelch repeats betabarrels betatrefoil repeats examples architecture closed solenoids frequently function proteinprotein interaction modules possible repeats must present form ligandbinding site located centre axis domain wheel
repetitive supradomain modules
common biology several borderline cases solenoid architectures regular protein domains proteins contain tandem repeats ordinary domains common eukaryotes even domains perfectly capable folding might bind together assume rigidly fixed orientation full protein supradomain modules perform functions individual constituents incapable famous example case tandem brct domains found tumor suppressor protein brca individual brct domains found certain proteins eg dna ligases binding dna tandem brct domains evolved novel function phosphorylated linear motif binding case brca mdc peptidebinding groove lies cleft formed junction two domains elegently explains individual constituents supradomain block incapable ligand binding proper assembly endows novel function therefore tandem brct domains regarded form single linear solenoid domain well
