the human skeleton is the internal framework of the body it is composed of 270 bones at birth this total decreases to 206 bones by adulthood after some bones have fused together the bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 30 the human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton the axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column the rib cage the skull and other associated bones the appendicular skeleton which is attached to the axial skeleton is formed by the pectoral girdle the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs
the human skeleton serves six major functions; support movement protection production of blood cells storage of ions and endocrine regulation
the human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull dentition long bones and pelves exist in general female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population the human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate child birth unlike most primates human males do not have penile bones

=== axial skeletonedit ===
the axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column (3234 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length) a part of the rib cage (12 pairs of ribs and the sternum) and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones)
the upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton which transmits the weight from the head the trunk and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints the bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments the erector spinae muscles are also supporting and are useful for balance
a human is able to survive with just the axial portion of their skeleton
=== appendicular skeletonedit ===
the appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles the upper limbs the pelvic girdle or pelvis and the lower limbs their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion excretion and reproduction
== functionsedit ==
the skeleton serves six major functions; support movement protection production of blood cells storage of minerals and endocrine regulation
=== supportedit ===
the skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape the pelvis associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures without the rib cages costal cartilages and intercostal muscles the lungs would collapse
=== movementedit ===
the joints between bones allow movement some allowing a wider range of movement than others e.g the ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck movement is powered by skeletal muscles which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles bones and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement all coordinated by the nervous system
it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly
=== protectionedit ===
the skeleton helps to protect our many vital internal organs from being damaged
the skull protects the brain
the vertebrae protect the spinal cord
the rib cage spine and sternum protect the lungs heart and major blood vessels
=== blood cell productionedit ===
the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow in children haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia in adults it occurs mainly in the pelvis cranium vertebrae and sternum
=== storageedit ===
the bone matrix can store calcium and is involved in calcium metabolism and bone marrow can store iron in ferritin and is involved in iron metabolism however bones are not entirely made of calcium but a mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite the latter making up 70% of a bone hydroxyapatite is in turn composed of 39.8% of calcium 41.4% of oxygen 18.5% of phosphorus and 0.2% of hydrogen by mass chondroitin sulfate is a sugar made up primarily of oxygen and carbon
=== endocrine regulationedit ===
bone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat
== sex differencesedit ==
anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas but tend to be limited in the skeleton the human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull dentition long bones and pelves (sing pelvis) are exhibited across human populations in general female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population
=== skulledit ===
a variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism such as the nuchal crest mastoid processes supraorbital margin supraorbital ridge and mental eminence
=== dentitionedit ===
human inter-sex dental dimorphism centers on the canines but it is not nearly as pronounced as in the other great apes
=== long bonesedit ===
long bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes sexual dimorphism in the long bones is commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses
=== pelvisedit ===
human pelves exhibit greater sexual dimorphism than other bones specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity ilia greater sciatic notches and the sub-pubic angle the phenice method is commonly used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96% to 100% accuracy in some populations
== disordersedit ==
there are many classified skeletal disorders one of the most common is osteoporosis also common is scoliosis a side-to-side curve in the back or spine often creating a pronounced "c" or "s" shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine this condition is most apparent during adolescence and is most common with females
=== arthritisedit ===
arthritis is a disorder of the joints it involves inflammation of one or more joints when affected by arthritis the joint or joints affected may be painful to move may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely the symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis the most common form of arthritis: osteoarthritis can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton the cartilage in the affected joints will degrade soften and wear away this decreases the mobility of the joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be
=== osteoporosisedit ===
osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density increasing the likelihood of fractures osteoporosis is defined by the world health organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass relative to the age and sex-matched average as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry with the term "established osteoporosis" including the presence of a fragility fracture osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause when it is called "postmenopausal osteoporosis" but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications specifically glucocorticoids osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs for this reason dexa scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture
osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking decrease alcohol consumption exercise regularly and have a healthy diet calcium supplements may also be advised as may vitamin d when medication is used it may include bisphosphonates strontium ranelate and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing hormone replacement therapy
== historyedit ==
the study of human bones probably started in ancient greece under ptolemaic kings due to their link to egypt herophilos through his work by studying dissected human corpses in alexandria is credited to be the pioneer of the field his works are lost but are often cited by notable perons in the field such as galen and rufus of ephesus
