iceland (/aslnd/ icelandic sland [istlant]) also called the republic of iceland is a nordic island country between the north atlantic and the arctic ocean it has a population of 329,100 and an area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi) making it the most sparsely populated country in europe the capital and largest city is reykjavk reykjavk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population iceland is volcanically and geologically active the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate
according to landnmabk the settlement of iceland began in 874 ce when the norwegian chieftain inglfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island in the following centuries mainly norwegians and to a smaller extent other scandinavians settled iceland bringing with them thralls of gaelic origin from 1262 to 1814 iceland was ruled by norway and afterwards by denmark until the 20th century the country relied largely on fishing and agriculture iceland became independent in 1918 and a republic in 1944 industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world in 1994 it became a part of the european economic area which supported diversification into economic and financial services
iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd countries it maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens iceland ranks highly in economic political and social stability and equality in 2013 it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the united nations human development index iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis the nation's entire banking system systemically failed in october 2008 leading to a severe depression substantial political unrest the icesave dispute and the institution of capital controls the economy has since made a significant recovery in large part due to a surge in tourism
icelandic culture is founded upon the nation's scandinavian heritage most icelanders are descendants of germanic and gaelic (celtic) settlers icelandic a north germanic language is descended from old norse and is closely related to faroese and west norwegian dialects the country's cultural heritage includes traditional icelandic cuisine icelandic literature and medieval sagas iceland has the smallest population of any nato member and is the only one with no standing army its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence
== historyedit ==
=== settlement and commonwealth 8741262edit ===
according to both landnmabk and slendingabk celtic monks known as the papar lived in iceland before scandinavian settlers arrived possibly members of a hiberno-scottish mission recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in hafnir on the reykjanes peninsula carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned somewhere between 770 and 880
swedish viking explorer garar svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island he stayed over winter and built a house in hsavk garar departed the following summer but one of his men nttfari decided to stay behind with two slaves nttfari settled in what is now known as nttfaravk and became the first permanent resident of iceland
the norse chieftain inglfr arnarson built his homestead in present-day reykjavk in the year 874 inglfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers largely scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were irish or scottish by 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986 the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century at this time about 25% of iceland was covered with forest compared to 1% in the present day christianity was adopted by consensus around 9991000 although norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards
=== the middle agesedit ===
the icelandic commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of icelandic chieftains the internal struggles and civil strife of the age of the sturlungs led to the signing of the old covenant in 1262 which ended the commonwealth and brought iceland under the norwegian crown possession of iceland passed to the kalmar union in 1415 when the kingdoms of norway denmark and sweden were united after the break-up of the union in 1523 it remained a norwegian dependency as a part of denmarknorway
in the ensuing centuries iceland became one of the poorest countries in europe infertile soil volcanic eruptions deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture the black death swept iceland twice first in 140204 and again in 149495 the former outbreak killed 50% to 60% of the population and the latter 30% to 50%
=== reformation and the early modern periodedit ===
around the middle of the 16th century as part of the protestant reformation king christian iii of denmark began to impose lutheranism on all his subjects jn arason the last catholic bishop of hlar was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons the country subsequently became officially lutheran and lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion
in the 17th and 18th centuries denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on iceland natural disasters including volcanic eruption and disease contributed to a decreasing population pirates from several countries including the barbary coast raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery a great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population in 1783 the laki volcano erupted with devastating effects in the years following the eruption known as the mist hardships (icelandic muharindin) over half of all livestock died in the country around a quarter of the population died in the ensuing famine
=== independence movement 18141918edit ===
in 1814 following the napoleonic wars denmark-norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the treaty of kiel but iceland remained a danish dependency throughout the 19th century the country's climate continued to grow colder resulting in mass emigration to the new world particularly to the region of gimli manitoba in canada which was sometimes referred to as new iceland about 15,000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70,000
a national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland europe an icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of jn sigursson based on the burgeoning icelandic nationalism inspired by the fjlnismenn and other danish-educated icelandic intellectuals in 1874 denmark granted iceland a constitution and limited home rule this was expanded in 1904 and hannes hafstein served as the first minister for iceland in the danish cabinet
=== kingdom of iceland 19181944edit ===
the danishicelandic act of union an agreement with denmark signed on 1 december 1918 and valid for 25 years recognised iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with denmark the government of iceland established an embassy in copenhagen and requested that denmark handle icelandic foreign policy danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags those of the kingdom of denmark and those of the kingdom of iceland
during world war ii iceland joined denmark in asserting neutrality after the german occupation of denmark on 9 april 1940 the althing replaced the king with a regent and declared that the icelandic government should assume the control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by denmark a month later british armed forces invaded and occupied the country violating icelandic neutrality in 1941 the occupation was taken over by the united states so that britain could use its troops elsewhere an arrangement reluctantly agreed to by the icelandic authorities
=== independent republic 1944presentedit ===
on 31 december 1943 the danishicelandic act of union expired after 25 years beginning on 20 may 1944 icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with denmark abolish the monarchy and establish a republic the vote was 97% to end the union and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution iceland formally became a republic on 17 june 1944 with sveinn bjrnsson as its first president
in 1946 the allied occupation force left iceland the nation formally became a member of nato on 30 march 1949 amid domestic controversy and riots on 5 may 1951 a defence agreement was signed with the united states american troops returned to iceland as the iceland defence force and remained throughout the cold war the us withdrew the last of its forces on 30 september 2006
iceland had prospered during the war the immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the us marshall plan programme through which icelanders received the most aid per capita of any european country (at usd 209 with the war-ravaged netherlands a distant second at usd 109)
the 1970s were marked by the cod wars several disputes with the united kingdom over iceland's extension of its fishing limits to 200 miles offshore iceland hosted a summit in reykjavk in 1986 between united states president ronald reagan and soviet premier mikhail gorbachev during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament a few years later iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of estonia latvia and lithuania as they broke away from the ussr throughout the 1990s the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes to that end iceland provided aid and expertise to various nato-led interventions in bosnia kosovo and iraq
iceland joined the european economic area in 1994 after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised international economic relations increased further after 2001 when iceland's newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt contributing to a 32% increase in iceland's gross national income between 2002 and 2007
==== economic boom and crisisedit ====
in the years 20032007 following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of dav oddsson iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services it was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis the crisis resulted in the greatest migration from iceland since 1887 with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009 iceland's economy stabilised under the government of jhanna sigurardttir and grew by 1.6% in 2012 many icelanders however have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies the centre-right independence party was returned to power in coalition with the progressive party in the 2013 elections
== geographyedit ==
iceland is located at the juncture of the north atlantic and arctic oceans the main island is entirely south of the arctic circle which passes through the small icelandic island of grmsey off the main island's northern coast the country lies between latitudes 63 and 68 n and longitudes 25 and 13 w
iceland is closer to continental europe than to mainland north america thus the island is generally included in europe for historical political cultural and practical reasons geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates the closest body of land is greenland (290 km 180 mi) the closest bodies of land in europe are the faroe islands (420 km 260 mi) jan mayen island (570 km 350 mi) shetland and the outer hebrides both about 740 km (460 mi) and the scottish mainland and orkney both about 750 km (470 mi) the mainland of norway is about 970 km (600 mi) away
iceland is the world's 18th largest island and europe's second largest island after great britain the main island is 101,826 km2 (39,315 sq mi) but the entire country is 103,000 km2 (39,768.5 sq mi) in size of which 62.7% is tundra there are thirty minor islands in iceland including the lightly populated grmsey and the vestmannaeyjar archipelago lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface only 23% is vegetated the largest lakes are risvatn reservoir 8388 km2 (3234 sq mi) and ingvallavatn 82 km2 (32 sq mi) other important lakes include lagarfljt and mvatn jkulsrln is the deepest lake at 248 m (814 ft)
geologically iceland is part of the mid-atlantic ridge a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust this part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume causing iceland to be subaerial (above the surface of the sea) the ridge marks the boundary between the eurasian and north american plates and iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge
many fjords punctuate iceland's 4,970-kilometre (3,088-mile) long coastline which is also where most settlements are situated the island's interior the highlands of iceland is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand mountains and lava fields the major towns are the capital city of reykjavk along with its outlying towns of kpavogur hafnarfjrur and garabr nearby reykjanesbr where the international airport is located and the town of akureyri in northern iceland the island of grmsey on the arctic circle contains the northernmost habitation of iceland whereas kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of iceland iceland has three national parks vatnajkull national park snfellsjkull national park and ingvellir national park the country is considered a strong performer in environmental protection having been ranked 13th in yale university's environmental performance index of 2012
=== geologyedit ===
a geologically young land iceland is located on both the iceland hotspot and the mid-atlantic ridge which runs right through it this location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes notably hekla eldgj herubrei and eldfell the volcanic eruption of laki in 17831784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population in addition the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of europe and parts of asia and africa for several months afterward and affected climates in other areas
iceland has many geysers including geysir from which the english word is derived and the famous strokkur which erupts every 810 minutes after a phase of inactivity geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000 geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often
with the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity most residents have access to inexpensive hot water heating and electricity the island is composed primarily of basalt a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in hawaii iceland however has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure) many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx 30 volcanic systems active
surtsey one of the youngest islands in the world is part of iceland named after surtr it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 november 1963 and 5 june 1968 only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island
on 21 march 2010 a volcano in eyjafjallajkull in the south of iceland erupted for the first time since 1821 forcing 600 people to flee their homes additional eruptions on 14 april forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across europe
another large eruption occurred on 21 may 2011 this time it was the grmsvtn volcano located under the thick ice of europe's largest glacier vatnajkull grmsvtn is one of iceland's most active volcanoes and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 eyjafjallajkull activity with ash and lava 20 km (12 mi) hurled into the atmosphere creating a large cloud
=== climateedit ===
the climate of iceland's coast is subpolar oceanic the warm north atlantic current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world regions in the world with similar climates include the aleutian islands the alaska peninsula and tierra del fuego although these regions are closer to the equator despite its proximity to the arctic the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter ice incursions are rare the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969
the climate varies between different parts of the island generally speaking the south coast is warmer wetter and windier than the north the central highlands are the coldest part of the country low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south
the highest air temperature recorded was 30.5 c (86.9 f) on 22 june 1939 at teigarhorn on the southeastern coast the lowest was 38 c (36.4 f) on 22 january 1918 at grmsstair and mrudalur in the northeastern hinterland the temperature records for reykjavk are 26.2 c (79.2 f) on 30 july 2008 and 24.5 c (12.1 f) on 21 january 1918
=== biodiversityedit ===
there are around 1,300 known species of insects in iceland which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide) the only native land mammal when humans arrived was the arctic fox which came to the island at the end of the ice age walking over the frozen sea on rare occasions bats have been carried to the island with the winds but they are not able to breed there polar bears occasionally come over from greenland but they are just visitors and no icelandic populations exist there are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island
phytogeographically iceland belongs to the arctic province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom approximately three quarters of the island is barren of vegetation plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock the most common tree native to iceland is the northern birch (betula pubescens) which formerly formed forests over much of iceland along with aspens (populus tremula) rowans (sorbus aucuparia) common junipers (juniperus communis) and other smaller trees mainly willows
when the island was first settled it was extensively forested in the late 12th-century ari the wise described it in slendingabk as forested from mountain to sea shore permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber deforestation climatic deterioration during the little ice age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion today many farms have been abandoned three-quarters of iceland's 100,000 square kilometres are affected by soil erosion 18,000 km2 (6,900 sq mi) so seriously as to be useless only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves the planting of new forests has increased the number of trees but does not compare to the original forests some of the planted forests include introduced species the tallest tree in iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in kirkjubjarklaustur it was measured at 25.2 metres (83 ft) in 2013
the animals of iceland include the icelandic sheep cattle chickens goats the sturdy icelandic horse and the icelandic sheepdog all descendants of animals imported by europeans wild mammals include the arctic fox mink mice rats rabbits and reindeer polar bears occasionally visit the island travelling on icebergs from greenland in june 2008 two polar bears arrived in the same month marine mammals include the grey seal (halichoerus grypus) and harbor seal (phoca vitulina) many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding iceland and the fishing industry is a major part of iceland's economy accounting for approximately half of the country's total exports birds especially seabirds are an important part of iceland's animal life puffins skuas and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs
commercial whaling is practised intermittently along with scientific whale hunts whale watching has become an important part of iceland's economy since 1997
== politicsedit ==
iceland has a leftright multi-party system following the 2013 parliamentary election the biggest parties are the centre-right independence party (sjlfstisflokkurinn) and the progressive party (framsknarflokkurinn) other political parties with seats in the althing are the centre-left social democratic alliance (samfylkingin) left-green movement (vinstrihreyfingin grnt frambo) bright future (bjrt framt) and the pirate party of iceland (pratar) many other parties exist on the municipal level most of which run only locally in a single municipality
iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women known as the women's list or women's alliance (kvennalistinn) it was founded in 1983 to advance the political economic and social needs of women after participating in its first parliamentary elections the women's list helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15% although it disbanded in 1999 merging with the social democratic alliance it left a lasting influence on iceland's politics every major party has a 40% quota for women and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female compared to the global average of 16%
in 2011 iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions and 13th in government transparency the country has a high level of civic participation with 81.4% voter turnout during the most recent elections compared to an oecd average of 72% however only 50% of icelanders say they trust their political institutions slightly less than the oecd average of 56% (and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the icelandic financial crisis)
=== governmentedit ===
iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic the modern parliament alingi (english althing) was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch it was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 consequently it is arguably the world's oldest parliamentary democracy. it currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit the elections for president the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years
the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but can veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum the current president is lafur ragnar grmsson the head of government is the prime minister (currently sigmundur dav gunnlaugsson) who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent sveinn bjrnsson who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941 appointed a non-parliamentary government the regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944
the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently in 1980 icelanders elected vigds finnbogadttir as president the world's first directly elected female head of state she retired from office in 1996 in 2009 iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when jhanna sigurardttir became prime minister
=== administrative divisionsedit ===
iceland is divided into regions constituencies and municipalities there are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division until 2003 the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies
reykjavk north and reykjavk south (city regions)
southwest (four non-contiguous suburban areas around reykjavk)
northwest and northeast (northern half of iceland split) and
south (southern half of iceland excluding reykjavk and suburbs)
the redistricting change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjavk city area the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system but still exists
there are 74 municipalities in iceland which govern local matters like schools transport and zoning these are the actual second-level subdivisions of iceland as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes reykjavk is by far the most populous municipality about four times more populous than kpavogur the second one
=== foreign relationsedit ===
iceland which is a member of the un nato efta and oecd maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations but its ties with the nordic countries germany the united states canada and the other nato nations are particularly close historically due to cultural economic and linguistic similarities iceland is a nordic country and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the nordic council
iceland is a member of the european economic area (eea) which allows the country access to the single market of the european union (eu) it was not a member of the eu but in july 2009 the icelandic parliament the althing voted in favour of application for eu membership and officially applied on 17 july 2009 however in 2013 opinion polls showed that many icelanders were now against joining the eu following recent elections the two parties that formed the island's new government the centrist progressive party and the right-wing independence party announced they would hold a referendum on eu membership
=== militaryedit ===
iceland has no standing army the u.s air force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the keflavk base until they were withdrawn on 30 september 2006 since may 2008 nato nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol icelandic airspace under the icelandic air policing mission iceland supported the 2003 invasion of iraq despite much domestic controversy deploying a coast guard eod team to iraq which was replaced later by members of the iceland crisis response unit iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in afghanistan and the 1999 nato bombing of yugoslavia despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 april 2009
icelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 reagangorbachev summit in reykjavk which set the stage for the end of the cold war iceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights conflict with the united kingdom led to a series of so-called cod wars in 19521956 due to the extension of iceland's fishing zone from 3 to 4 nmi (5.6 to 7.4 km 3.5 to 4.6 mi) 195861 following a further extension to 12 nmi (22.2 km 13.8 mi) 197273 with another extension to 50 nmi (92.6 km 57.5 mi) and in 197576 another extension to 200 nmi (370.4 km 230.2 mi)
according to the global peace index iceland is the most peaceful country in the world due to its lack of armed forces low crime rate and high level of socio-political stability
== economyedit ==
in 2007 iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita (us$54,858) and the fifth most productive by gdp at purchasing power parity ($40,112) about 85 percent of total primary energy supply in iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources utilization of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita as a result of its commitment to renewable energy the 2014 global green economy index ranked iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world historically iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force the economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports fish and fish products aluminium and ferrosilicon whaling in iceland has been historically significant iceland still relies heavily on fishing but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006
until the 20th century iceland was among the poorest countries in western europe currently it remains one of the most developed countries in the world strong economic growth had led iceland to be ranked first in the united nations human development index report for 2007/2008 although as of 2011 its hdi rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis nevertheless according to the economist intelligence index of 2011 iceland has the 2nd highest quality of life in the world based on the gini coefficient iceland also has one of the lowest rates of income inequality in the world and when adjusted for inequality its hdi ranking climbs to 5th place iceland's unemployment rate has declined consistently since the crisis with 4.8% of the labour force being unemployed as of june 2012 compared to 6% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2010
many political parties remain opposed to eu membership primarily due to icelanders concern about losing control over their natural resources (particularly fisheries) the national currency of iceland is the icelandic krna (isk)
a poll released on 5 march 2010 by capacent gallup showed that 31% of respondents were in favour of adopting the euro and 69% opposed another capacent gallup poll conducted in february 2012 found that 67.4% of icelanders would reject eu membership in a referendum
iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade including software production biotechnology and finance industry accounts for around a quarter of economic activity while services comprise close to 70% despite the decision to resume commercial whale hunting in 2006 the tourism sector is expanding especially in ecotourism and whale-watching on average iceland receives around 1.1 million visitors annually which is more than three times the native population iceland's agriculture industry accounting for 5.4% of gdp consists mainly of potatoes green vegetables (in greenhouses) mutton and dairy products the financial centre is borgartn in reykjavk which hosts a large number of companies and three investment banks iceland's stock market the iceland stock exchange (ise) was established in 1985
iceland is ranked 27th in the 2012 index of economic freedom lower than in prior years but still among the freest in the world as of 2012 it ranks 30th in the world economic forum's global competitive index one place higher than in 2011 according to insead's global innovation index iceland is the 11th most innovative country in the world unlike most western european countries iceland has a flat tax system the main personal income tax rate is a flat 22.75% and combined with municipal taxes the total tax rate equals no more than 35.7% not including the many deductions that are available the corporate tax rate is a flat 18% one of the lowest in the world there is also a value added tax whereas a net wealth tax was eliminated in 2006 employment regulations are relatively flexible and the labour market is one of the freest in the world property rights are strong and iceland is one of the few countries where they are applied to fishery management like other welfare states taxpayers pay various subsidies to each other but with spending being less than in most european countries
despite low tax rates agricultural assistance is the highest among oecd countries and a potential impediment to structural change also health care and education spending have relatively poor returns by oecd measures though improvements have been made in both areas the oecd economic survey of iceland 2008 had highlighted iceland's challenges in currency and macroeconomic policy there was a currency crisis that started in the spring of 2008 and on 6 october trading in iceland's banks was suspended as the government battled to save the economy the latest assessment by the oecd determined that iceland has made progress in many areas particularly in creating a sustainable fiscal policy and restoring the health of the financial sector however challenges remain in making the fishing industry more efficient and sustainable as well as in improving monetary policy in order to address inflation iceland's public debt remains around 120% as of 2012 the 10th highest in the world by proportion of national gdp
=== economic contractionedit ===
