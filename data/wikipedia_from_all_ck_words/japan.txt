== historyedit ==
=== prehistory and ancient historyedit ===
a paleolithic culture around 30,000 bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago this was followed from around 14,000 bc (the start of the jmon period) by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture who include ancestors of both the contemporary ainu people and yamato people characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world around 300 bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jmon the yayoi period starting around 500 bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming a new style of pottery and metallurgy introduced from china and korea
japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called yamataikoku buddhism was first introduced to japan from baekje of korea but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period (592710)
the nara period (710784) of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong japanese state centered on an imperial court in heij-ky (modern nara) the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture the smallpox epidemic of 735737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan's population in 784 emperor kammu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-ky before relocating it to heian-ky (modern kyoto) in 794
this marked the beginning of the heian period (7941185) during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibu's the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan's national anthem kimigayo were written during this time
buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saich and shingon by kkai pure land buddhism (jdo-sh jdo shinsh) greatly becomes popular in the latter half of the 11th century
=== feudal eraedit ===
japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai in 1185 following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shogun and established a base of power in kamakura after his death the hj clan came to power as regents for the shoguns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period (11851333) and became popular among the samurai class the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336
ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period (13361573) the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism (art of miyabi) prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyo) and a civil war (the nin war) began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period ("warring states")
during the 16th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyo his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchimomoyama period (15731603) after he was assassinated in 1582 his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597
tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support when open war broke out he defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in 1600 ieyasu was appointed shogun in 1603 and established the tokugawa shogunate at edo (modern tokyo) the tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period (16031868) the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku ("national studies") the study of japan by the japanese
=== modern eraedit ===
on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shogun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the meiji restoration)
adopting western political judicial and military institutions the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence after victories in the first sino-japanese war (18941895) and the russo-japanese war (19041905) japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935

the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war (19371945) the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre in 1940 the empire then invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan on december 78 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor attacks on british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war bringing the us and the uk into world war ii in the pacific after the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15 the war cost japan and the rest of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere millions of lives and left much of the nation's industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies (led by the us) repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some japanese leaders for war crimes however the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the supreme commander for the allied powers despite calls for trials for both groups
in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery on march 11 2011 japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power

about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world
the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago

in the sea of japan zone on honshu's west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn wind the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter and between day and night precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the chgoku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round
the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season
