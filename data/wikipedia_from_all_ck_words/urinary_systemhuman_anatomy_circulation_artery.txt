an ion (/an -n/) is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge
ions can be created by either chemical or physical means via ionization in chemical terms if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons it has a net positive charge and is known as a cation if an atom gains electrons it has a net negative charge and is known as an anion an ion consisting of a single atom is an atomic or monatomic ion if it consists of two or more atoms it is a molecular or polyatomic ion because of their electric charges cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds such as salts
in the case of physical ionization of a medium such as a gas what are known as ion pairs are created by ion impact and each pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion
== history of discoveryedit ==
the word ion is the greek  ion going the present participle of  ienai to go this term was introduced by english physicist and chemist michael faraday in 1834 for the then-unknown species that goes from one electrode to the other through an aqueous medium faraday did not know the nature of these species but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode that some kind of substance moved through the solution in a current conveying matter from one place to the other
faraday also introduced the words anion for a negatively charged ion and cation for a positively charged one in faraday's nomenclature cations were named because they were attracted to the cathode in a galvanic device and anions were named due to their attraction to the anode
svante arrhenius put forth in his 1884 dissertation his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved for which he would win the 1903 nobel prize in chemistry arrhenius explanation was that in forming a solution the salt dissociates into faraday's ions arrhenius proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current

ions in their gas-like state are highly reactive and do not occur in large amounts on earth except in flames lightning electrical sparks and other plasmas these gas-like ions rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example water) to produce solvated ions, which are more stable for reasons involving a combination of energy and entropy changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid these stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures a common example is the ions present in seawater which are derived from the dissolved salts
all ions are charged which means that like all charged objects they are
attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative and vice versa)
repelled by like charges
when moving travel in trajectories that are deflected by a magnetic field
electrons due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as matter waves determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all thus anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion because its size is determined by its electron cloud as such in general cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of its electron cloud one particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons and thus consists of a single proton - very much smaller than the parent hydrogen atom
=== anions and cationsedit ===
since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons
an anion () (/n.a.n/ an-eye-n) from the greek word (n) meaning up is an ion with more electrons than protons giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged)
a cation (+) (/kt.a.n/ kat-eye-n) from the greek word (kat) meaning down is an ion with fewer electrons than protons giving it a positive charge
there are additional names used for ions with multiple charges for example an ion with a 2 charge is known as a dianion and an ion with a +2 charge is known as a dication a zwitterion is a neutral molecule with positive and negative charges at different locations within that molecule
=== natural occurrencesedit ===
ions are ubiquitous in nature and are responsible for diverse phenomena from the luminescence of the sun to the existence of the earth's ionosphere atoms in their ionic state may have a different color from neutral atoms and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the color of gemstones in both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry) the interaction of water and ions is extremely important an example is the energy that drives breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (atp) the following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale from the astronomical to the microscopic
==== astronomicaledit ====
a collection of non-aqueous gas-like ions or even a gas containing a proportion of charged particles is called a plasma greater than 99.9% of visible matter in the universe may be in the form of plasmas these include our sun and other stars and the space between planets as well as the space in between stars plasmas are often called the fourth state of matter because their properties are substantially different from those of solids liquids and gases astrophysical plasmas predominantly contain a mixture of electrons and protons (ionized hydrogen)
== related technologyedit ==
ions can be non-chemically prepared using various ion sources usually involving high voltage or temperature these are used in a multitude of devices such as mass spectrometers optical emission spectrometers particle accelerators ion implanters and ion engines
as reactive charged particles they are also used in air purification by disrupting microbes and in household items such as smoke detectors
as signaling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across membranes the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death this is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial biocides including the ion channels gramicidin and amphotericin (a fungicide)
inorganic dissolved ions are a component of total dissolved solids an indicator of water quality in the world
=== detection of ionising radiationedit ===
the ionising effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as alpha beta gamma and x-rays the original ionisation event in these instruments results in the formation of an ion pair a positive ion and a free electron by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules the ionization chamber is the simplest of these detectors and collects all the charges created by direct ionisation within the gas through the application of an electric field
the geigermller tube and the proportional counter both use a phenomenon known as a townsend avalanche to multiply the effect of the original ionising event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact

=== notationedit ===
==== denoting the charged stateedit ====
when writing the chemical formula for an ion its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom the net charge is written with the magnitude before the sign that is a doubly charged cation is indicated as 2+ instead of +2 however the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms for example the sodium cation is indicated as na+ and not na1+
an alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times this is often seen with transition metals chemists sometimes circle the sign this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning all three representations of fe2+ shown in the figure are thus equivalent
monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with roman numerals for example the fe2+ example seen above is occasionally referred to as fe(ii) or feii the roman numeral designates the formal oxidation state of an element whereas the superscripted numerals denotes the net charge the two notations are therefore exchangeable for monatomic ions but the roman numerals cannot be applied to polyatomic ions however it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal center with a polyatomic complex as shown by the uranyl ion example
==== sub-classesedit ====
if an ion contains unpaired electrons it is called a radical ion just like uncharged radicals radical ions are very reactive polyatomic ions containing oxygen such as carbonate and sulfate are called oxyanions molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called organic ions if the charge in an organic ion is formally centered on a carbon it is termed a carbocation (if positively charged) or carbanion (if negatively charged)
=== formationedit ===
==== formation of monatomic ionsedit ====
monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the valence shell (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom the inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged atomic nucleus and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction the process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ionization
atoms can be ionized by bombardment with radiation but the more usual process of ionization encountered in chemistry is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules this transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable ("closed shell") electronic configurations atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy
for example a sodium atom na has a single electron in its valence shell surrounding 2 stable filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons since these filled shells are very stable a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration becoming a sodium cation in the process
na na+ + e
on the other hand a chlorine atom cl has 7 electrons in its valence shell which is one short of the stable filled shell with 8 electrons thus a chlorine atom tends to gain an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration becoming a chloride anion in the process
cl + e cl
this driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction wherein the extra electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine forming sodium cations and chloride anions being oppositely charged these cations and anions form ionic bonds and combine to form sodium chloride nacl more commonly known as table salt
na+ + cl nacl
==== formation of polyatomic and molecular ionsedit ====
polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton h+ in neutral molecules for example when ammonia nh3 accepts a proton h+a process called protonationit forms the ammonium ion nh4+ ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same electronic configuration but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge
ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge forming the ion nh+
3 however this ion is unstable because it has an incomplete valence shell around the nitrogen atom making it a very reactive radical ion
due to the instability of radical ions polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as h+ rather than gaining or losing electrons this allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge
==== ionization potentialedit ====
the energy required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ionization potential or ionization energy the nth ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its nth electron after the first n 1 electrons have already been detached
each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last particularly great increases occur after any given block of atomic orbitals is exhausted of electrons for this reason ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks for example sodium has one valence electron in its outermost shell so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron as na+ on the other side of the periodic table chlorine has seven valence electrons so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron as cl caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest in general the ionization energy of metals is much lower than the ionization energy of nonmetals which is why in general metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions
=== ionic bondingedit ===
ionic bonding is a kind of chemical bonding that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions ions of like charge repel each other and ions of opposite charge attract each other therefore ions do not usually exist on their own but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a crystal lattice the resulting compound is called an ionic compound and is said to be held together by ionic bonding in ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbors from which the spatial extension and the ionic radius of individual ions may be derived
the most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except noble gases which rarely form chemical compounds) metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable closed-shell electronic configuration as such they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration this property is known as electropositivity non-metals on the other hand are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration as such they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration this tendency is known as electronegativity when a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms this reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions which are attracted to each other to form a salt
