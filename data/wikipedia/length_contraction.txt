in physics length contraction is the phenomenon of a decrease in length of an object as measured by an observer which is traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the object this contraction (more formally called lorentz contraction or lorentzfitzgerald contraction after hendrik lorentz and george fitzgerald) is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light length contraction is only in the direction parallel to the direction in which the observed body is travelling this effect is negligible at everyday speeds and can be ignored for all regular purposes only at greater speeds does it become relevant at a speed of 13,400,000 m/s (30 million mph 0.0447c) the contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of 42,300,000 m/s (95 million mph 0.141c) the length is still 99% as the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light the effect becomes dominant as can be seen from the formula:
where
l0 is the proper length (the length of the object in its rest frame)
l is the length observed by an observer in relative motion with respect to the object
v is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object
c is the speed of light
and the lorentz factor (v) is defined as
in this equation it is assumed that the object is parallel with its line of movement for the observer in relative movement the length of the object is measured by subtracting the simultaneously measured distances of both ends of the object for more general conversions see the lorentz transformations an observer at rest viewing an object travelling very close to the speed of light would observe the length of the object in the direction of motion as very near zero
== historyedit ==
length contraction was postulated by george fitzgerald (1889) and hendrik antoon lorentz (1892) to explain the negative outcome of the michelson-morley experiment and to rescue the hypothesis of the stationary aether (lorentzfitzgerald contraction hypothesis) although both fitzgerald and lorentz alluded to the fact that electrostatic fields in motion were deformed ("heaviside-ellipsoid" after oliver heaviside who derived this deformation from electromagnetic theory in 1888) it was considered an ad hoc hypothesis because at this time there was no sufficient reason to assume that intermolecular forces behave the same way as electromagnetic ones in 1897 joseph larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of this model yet it was shown by henri poincar (1905) that electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain the electron's stability so he had to introduce another ad hoc hypothesis: non-electric binding forces (poincar stresses) that ensure the electron's stability give a dynamical explanation for length contraction and thus hide the motion of the stationary aether
eventually albert einstein (1905) was the first to completely remove the ad hoc character from the contraction hypothesis by demonstrating that this contraction did not require motion through a supposed aether but could be explained using special relativity which changed our notions of space time and simultaneity einstein's view was further elaborated by hermann minkowski who demonstrated the geometrical interpretation of all relativistic effects by introducing his concept of four-dimensional spacetime
== basis in relativityedit ==
first it is necessary to carefully consider the methods for measuring the lengths of resting and moving objects here "object" simply means a distance with endpoints that are always mutually at rest i.e. that are at rest in the same inertial frame of reference if the relative velocity between an observer (or his measuring instruments) and the observed object is zero then the proper length of the object can simply be determined by directly superposing a measuring rod however if the relative velocity > 0 then one can proceed as follows:
the observer installs a row of clocks that either are synchronized a) by exchanging light signals according to the poincar-einstein synchronization or b) by "slow clock transport" that is one clock is transported along the row of clocks in the limit of vanishing transport velocity now when the synchronization process is finished the object is moved along the clock row and every clock stores the exact time when the left or the right end of the object passes by after that the observer only has to look after the position of a clock a that stored the time when the left end of the object was passing by and a clock b at which the right end of the object was passing by at the same time it's clear that distance ab is equal to length of the moving object using this method the definition of simultaneity is crucial for measuring the length of moving objects
another method is to use a clock indicating its proper time  which is traveling from one endpoint of the rod to the other in time as measured by clocks in the rod's rest frame the length of the rod can be computed by multiplying its travel time by its velocity thus in the rod's rest frame or in the clock's rest frame
in newtonian mechanics simultaneity and time duration are absolute and therefore both methods lead to the equality of and  yet in relativity theory the constancy of light velocity in all inertial frames in connection with relativity of simultaneity and time dilation destroys this equality in the first method an observer in one frame claims to have measured the object's endpoints simultaneously but the observers in all other inertial frames will argue that the object's endpoints were not measured simultaneously in the second method times and are not equal due to time dilation resulting in different lengths too
the deviation between the measurements in all inertial frames is given by the formulas for lorentz transformation and time dilation (see derivation) it turns out that the proper length remains unchanged and always denotes the greatest length of an object yet the length of the same object as measured in another inertial frame is shorter than the proper length this contraction only occurs in the line of motion and can be represented by the following relation (where is the relative velocity and the speed of light)
== symmetryedit ==
the principle of relativity (according to which the laws of nature must assume the same form in all inertial reference frames) requires that length contraction is symmetrical: if a rod rests in inertial frame s it has its proper length in s and its length is contracted in s' however if a rod rests in s' it has its proper length in s' and its length is contracted in s this can be vividly illustrated using symmetric minkowski diagrams (or loedel diagrams) because the lorentz transformation geometrically corresponds to a rotation in four-dimensional spacetime
first image: if a rod at rest in s' is given then its endpoints are located upon the ct' axis and the axis parallel to it in this frame the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x') positions of the endpoints are o and b thus the proper length is given by ob but in s the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x) positions are o and a thus the contracted length is given by oa
on the other hand if another rod is at rest in s then its endpoints are located upon the ct axis and the axis parallel to it in this frame the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x) positions of the endpoints are o and d thus the proper length is given by od but in s' the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x') positions are o and c thus the contracted length is given by oc
second image: a train at rest in s and a station at rest in s' with relative velocity of are given in s a rod with proper length is located so its contracted length in s' is given by:
then the rod will be thrown out of the train in s and will come to rest at the station in s' its length has to be measured again according to the methods given above and now the proper length will be measured in s' (the rod has become larger in that system) while in s the rod is in motion and therefore its length is contracted (the rod has become smaller in that system):
== experimental verificationsedit ==
any observer co-moving with the observed object cannot measure the object's contraction because he can judge himself and the object as at rest in the same inertial frame in accordance with the principle of relativity (as it was demonstrated by the trouton-rankine experiment) so length contraction cannot be measured in the object's rest frame but only in a frame in which the observed object is in motion in addition even in such a non-co-moving frame direct experimental confirmations of length contraction are hard to achieve because at the current state of technology objects of considerable extension cannot be accelerated to relativistic speeds and the only objects traveling with the speed required are atomic particles yet whose spatial extensions are too small to allow a direct measurement of contraction
however there are indirect confirmations of this effect in a non-co-moving frame:
it was the negative result of a famous experiment that required the introduction of length contraction: the michelson-morley experiment (and later also the kennedythorndike experiment) in special relativity its explanation is as follows: in its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion the transverse beam must traverse a longer diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times l/(c-v) & l/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer therefore in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s) thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation
the range of action of muons at high velocities is much higher than that of slower ones the atmosphere has its proper length in the earth frame while the increased muon range is explained by their longer lifetimes due to time dilation (see time dilation of moving particles) however in the muon frame their lifetime is unchanged but the atmosphere is contracted so that even their small range is sufficient to reach the surface of earth
heavy ions that are spherical when at rest should assume the form of "pancakes" or flat disks when traveling nearly at the speed of light and in fact the results obtained from particle collisions can only be explained when the increased nucleon density due to length contraction is considered
the ionization ability of electrically charged particles with large relative velocities is higher than expected in pre-relativistic physics the ability should decrease at high velocities because the time in which ionizing particles in motion can interact with the electrons of other atoms or molecules is diminished though in relativity the higher-than-expected ionization ability can be explained by length contraction of the coulomb field in frames in which the ionizing particles are moving which increases their electrical field strength normal to the line of motion
in free-electron lasers relativistic electrons were injected into an undulator so that synchrotron radiation is generated in the proper frame of the electrons the undulator is contracted which leads to an increased radiation frequency additionally to find out the frequency as measured in the laboratory frame one has to apply the relativistic doppler effect so only with the aid of length contraction and the relativistic doppler effect the extremely small wavelength of undulator radiation can be explained
== reality of length contractionedit ==
in 1911 vladimir variak asserted that length contraction is "real" according to lorentz while it is "apparent or subjective" according to einstein einstein replied:
the author unjustifiably stated a difference of lorentz's view and that of mine concerning the physical facts the question as to whether length contraction really exists or not is misleading it doesn't "really" exist in so far as it doesn't exist for a comoving observer; though it "really" exists i.e in such a way that it could be demonstrated in principle by physical means by a non-comoving observer
einstein also argued in that paper that length contraction is not simply the product of arbitrary definitions concerning the way clock regulations and length measurements are performed he presented the following thought experiment: let a'b' and a"b" be the endpoints of two rods of same proper length let them move in opposite directions with same speed with respect to a resting coordinate x-axis endpoints a'a" meet at point a* and b'b" meet at point b* both points being marked on that axis einstein pointed out that length a*b* is shorter than a'b' or a"b" which can also be demonstrated by one of the rods when brought to rest with respect to that axis
== paradoxesedit ==
due to superficial application of the contraction formula some paradoxes can occur for examples see the ladder paradox or bell's spaceship paradox however those paradoxes can simply be solved by a correct application of relativity of simultaneity another famous paradox is the ehrenfest paradox which proves that the concept of rigid bodies is not compatible with relativity reducing the applicability of born rigidity and showing that for a co-rotating observer the geometry is in fact non-euclidean
== visual effectsedit ==
length contraction refers to measurements of position made at simultaneous times according to a coordinate system this could suggest that if one could take a picture of a fast moving object that the image would show the object contracted in the direction of motion however such visual effects are completely different measurements as such a photograph is taken from a distance while length contraction can only directly be measured at the exact location of the object's endpoints it was shown by several authors such as roger penrose and james terrell that moving objects generally do not appear length contracted on a photograph for instance for a small angular diameter a moving sphere remains circular and is rotated this kind of visual rotation effect is called penrose-terrell rotation
== derivationedit ==
=== lorentz transformationedit ===
length contraction can be derived from the lorentz transformation in several ways:
==== moving length is knownedit ====
in an inertial reference frame s and shall denote the endpoints of an object in motion in this frame there its length was measured according to the above convention by determining the simultaneous positions of its endpoints at  now the proper length of this object in s' shall be calculated by using the lorentz transformation transforming the time coordinates from s into s' results in different times but this is not problematic as the object is at rest in s' where it does not matter when the endpoints are measured therefore the transformation of the spatial coordinates suffices which gives:
since  and by setting and  the proper length in s' is given by
with respect to which the measured length in s is contracted by
according to the relativity principle objects that are at rest in s have to be contracted in s' as well by exchanging the above signs and primes symmetrically it follows:
thus the contracted length as measured in s' is given by:
==== proper length is knownedit ====
conversely if the object rests in s and its proper length is known the simultaneity of the measurements at the object's endpoints has to be considered in another frame s' as the object constantly changes its position there therefore both spatial and temporal coordinates must be transformed:
with and this results in non-simultaneous differences:
in order to obtain the simultaneous positions of both endpoints the distance traveled by the second endpoint with during must be subtracted from :
so the moving length in s' is contracted likewise the preceding calculation gives a symmetric result for an object at rest in s':
=== time dilationedit ===
length contraction can also be derived from time dilation according to which the rate of a single "moving" clock (indicating its proper time ) is lower with respect to two synchronized "resting" clocks (indicating ) time dilation was experimentally confirmed multiple times and is represented by the relation:
suppose a rod of proper length at rest in and a clock at rest in are moving along each other the respective travel times of the clock between the rod's endpoints are given by in and in  thus and  by inserting the time dilation formula the ratio between those lengths is:
therefore the length measured in is given by
so the effect that the moving clock indicates a lower travel time in due to time dilation is interpreted in as due to length contraction of the moving rod likewise if the clock were at rest in and the rod in  the above procedure would give
=== geometrical considerationsedit ===
additional geometrical considerations show that length contraction can be regarded as a trigonometric phenomenon with analogy to parallel slices through a cuboid before and after a rotation in e3 (see left half figure at the right) this is the euclidean analog of boosting a cuboid in e1,2 in the latter case however we can interpret the boosted cuboid as the world slab of a moving plate
image: left: a rotated cuboid in three-dimensional euclidean space e3 the cross section is longer in the direction of the rotation than it was before the rotation right: the world slab of a moving thin plate in minkowski spacetime (with one spatial dimension suppressed) e1,2 which is a boosted cuboid the cross section is thinner in the direction of the boost than it was before the boost in both cases the transverse directions are unaffected and the three planes meeting at each corner of the cuboids are mutually orthogonal (in the sense of e1,2 at right and in the sense of e3 at left)
in special relativity poincar transformations are a class of affine transformations which can be characterized as the transformations between alternative cartesian coordinate charts on minkowski spacetime corresponding to alternative states of inertial motion (and different choices of an origin) lorentz transformations are poincar transformations which are linear transformations (preserve the origin) lorentz transformations play the same role in minkowski geometry (the lorentz group forms the isotropy group of the self-isometries of the spacetime) which are played by rotations in euclidean geometry indeed special relativity largely comes down to studying a kind of noneuclidean trigonometry in minkowski spacetime as suggested by the following table:
