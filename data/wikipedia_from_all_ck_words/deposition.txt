a greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated ghg) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range this process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect the primary greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone without greenhouse gases the average temperature of earth's surface would be about 15 c (27 f) colder than the present average of 14 c (57 f) in the solar system the atmospheres of venus mars and titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect
human activities since the beginning of the industrial revolution (taken as the year 1750) have produced a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from 280 ppm in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2015 this increase has occurred despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions by various natural sinks involved in the carbon cycle anthropogenic carbon dioxide (co2) emissions (i.e emissions produced by human activities) come from combustion of carbon-based fuels principally coal oil and natural gas along with deforestation
it has been estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the present rate earth's surface temperature could exceed historical values as early as 2047 with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems biodiversity and the livelihoods of people worldwide
== gases in earth's atmosphere ==
=== greenhouse gases ===
greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the wavelength range emitted by earth in order the most abundant greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere are
water vapor (h
2o)
carbon dioxide (co2)
methane (ch
4)
nitrous oxide (n
2o)
ozone (o
3)
chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs)
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound) the proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the airborne fraction (af) more precisely the annual af is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year's total emissions for co2 the af over the last 50 years (19562006) has been increasing at 0.25 0.21%/year
=== non-greenhouse gases ===
although contributing to many other physical and chemical reactions the major atmospheric constituents nitrogen (n
2) oxygen (o
2) and argon (ar) are not greenhouse gases this is because molecules containing two atoms of the same element such as n
2 and o
2 and monatomic molecules such as argon (ar) have no net change in their dipole moment when they vibrate and hence are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as carbon monoxide (co) or hydrogen chloride (hcl) absorb ir these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility because co and hcl do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect they are usually omitted when discussing greenhouse gases
=== indirect radiative effects ===
some gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves) this happens in two main ways one way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas for example methane and carbon monoxide (co) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor that will be considered below) oxidation of co to co2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle the peak of the thermal ir emission from earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of co2 (667 cm1) on the other hand the single co vibrational band only absorbs ir at much higher frequencies (2145 cm1) where the ~300 k thermal emission of the surface is at least a factor of ten lower on the other hand oxidation of methane to co2 which requires reactions with the oh radical produces an instantaneous reduction since co2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane but it has a longer lifetime as described below this is not the whole story since the oxidations of co and ch
4 are intertwined by both consuming oh radicals in any case the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing
a second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases for example the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds (nmvocs) in the atmosphere can produce ozone the size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted
methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming co2 firstly the main chemical that destroys methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical (oh) methane reacts with oh and so more methane means that the concentration of oh goes down effectively methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect the second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone thirdly as well as making co2 the oxidation of methane produces water this is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere which is otherwise very dry co and nmvoc also produce co2 when they are oxidized they remove oh from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane the surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of co is three times that of co2 the same process that converts nmvoc to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone finally hydrogen can lead to ozone production and ch
4 increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere
=== contribution of clouds to earth's greenhouse effect ===
the major non-gas contributor to earth's greenhouse effect clouds also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere
== impacts on the overall greenhouse effect ==
the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is affected by the characteristics of that gas its abundance and any indirect effects it may cause for example the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime on the other hand in addition to its direct radiative impact methane has a large indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation shindell et al (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect
when ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect the most important are
in addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (see ipcc list of greenhouse gases) some greenhouse gases are not often listed for example nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential (gwp) but is only present in very small quantities
=== proportion of direct effects at a given moment ===
it is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect this is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas the higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases in addition some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified
=== atmospheric lifetime ===
aside from water vapor which has a residence time of about nine days major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases jacob (1999) defines the lifetime of an atmospheric species x in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of x remains in the box mathematically can be defined as the ratio of the mass (in kg) of x in the box to its removal rate which is the sum of the flow of x out of the box () chemical loss of x () and deposition of x () (all in kg/s)  if one stopped pouring any of this gas into the box then after a time  its concentration would be about halved
the atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil the oceans and other waters or vegetation and other biological systems reducing the excess to background concentrations the average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime
carbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime and cannot be specified precisely the atmospheric lifetime of co2 is estimated of the order of 3095 years this figure accounts for co2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean photosynthesis and other processes however this excludes the balancing fluxes of co2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs which have slower characteristic rates although more than half of the co2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction (about 20%) of emitted co2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases many of which have longer mean lifetimes than co2 e.g. n2o has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years
=== radiative forcing ===
earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy if this energy balance is shifted earth's surface could become warmer or cooler leading to a variety of changes in global climate
a number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in earth's climate greenhouse gases are one such mechanism greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from earth's surface causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere as explained above some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries and therefore can affect earth's energy balance over a long time period factors that influence earth's energy balance can be quantified in terms of radiative climate forcing. positive radiative forcing indicates warming (for example by increasing incoming energy or decreasing the amount of energy that escapes to space) whereas negative forcing is associated with cooling
=== global warming potential ===
the global warming potential (gwp) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime gwp is measured relative to the same mass of co2 and evaluated for a specific timescale thus if a gas has a high (positive) radiative forcing but also a short lifetime it will have a large gwp on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale conversely if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than co2 its gwp will increase with the timescale considered carbon dioxide is defined to have a gwp of 1 over all time periods
methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 3 years the 2007 ipcc report lists the gwp as 72 over a time scale of 20 years 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years a 2014 analysis however states that although methane's initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of co2 because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime after six or seven decades the impact of the two gases is about equal and from then on methane's relative role continues to decline the decrease in gwp at longer times is because methane is degraded to water and co2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere
examples of the atmospheric lifetime and gwp relative to co2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table
the use of cfc-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties the phasing-out of less active hcfc-compounds will be completed in 2030
== natural and anthropogenic sources ==
aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources during the pre-industrial holocene concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant in the industrial era human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests
the 2007 fourth assessment report compiled by the ipcc (ar4) noted that changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system and concluded that increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century in ar4 most of is defined as more than 50%
abbreviations used in the two tables below ppm = parts-per-million ppb = parts-per-billion ppt = parts-per-trillion w/m2 = watts per square metre
ice cores provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years (see the following section) both co2 and ch
4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record a record that indicates co2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180 ppm to 280 ppm throughout the last 800,000 years until the increase of the last 250 years however various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs 500 million years ago co2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now indeed higher co2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the phanerozoic eon with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the mesozoic era and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early palaeozoic era until the middle of the devonian period about 400 ma the spread of land plants is thought to have reduced co2 concentrations during the late devonian and plant activities as both sources and sinks of co2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks earlier still a 200-million year period of intermittent widespread glaciation extending close to the equator (snowball earth) appears to have been ended suddenly about 550 ma by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the co2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12% about 350 times modern levels causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as limestone at the rate of about 1 mm per day this episode marked the close of the precambrian eon and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the phanerozoic during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved no volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since in the modern era emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1% of emissions from human sources
=== ice cores ===
measurements from antarctic ice cores show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric co2 mole fractions were about 280 parts per million (ppm) and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009 one study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300 ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual co2 variability because of the way air is trapped in ice (pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn) and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels
=== changes since the industrial revolution ===
since the beginning of the industrial revolution the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased for example the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280 ppm by about 36% to 380 ppm or 100 ppm over modern pre-industrial levels the first 50 ppm increase took place in about 200 years from the start of the industrial revolution to around 1973. however the next 50 ppm increase took place in about 33 years from 1973 to 2006
recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate in the 1960s the average annual increase was only 37% of what it was in 2000 through 2007
today the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum (0.04%) compared with the existing stock this increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions
the other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase many observations are available online in a variety of atmospheric chemistry observational databases
== anthropogenic greenhouse gases ==
since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100 ppm higher than pre-industrial levels natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton as a result of this balance the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era
it is likely that anthropogenic (i.e. human-induced) warming such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems future warming is projected to have a range of impacts including sea level rise increased frequencies and severities of some extreme weather events loss of biodiversity and regional changes in agricultural productivity
the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are
burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) account for up to one third of total anthropogenic co2 emissions
livestock enteric fermentation and manure management paddy rice farming land use and wetland changes pipeline losses and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are sources of atmospheric methane
use of chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) in refrigeration systems and use of cfcs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes
agricultural activities including the use of fertilizers that lead to higher nitrous oxide (n
2o) concentrations
the seven sources of co2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for 20002004)
carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide (n
2o) and three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride (sf
6) hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs) and perfluorocarbons (pfcs)) are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are regulated under the kyoto protocol international treaty which came into force in 2005 emissions limitations specified in the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 the cancn agreement agreed in 2010 includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries to control emissions at the time of the agreement these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions
although cfcs are greenhouse gases they are regulated by the montreal protocol which was motivated by cfcs contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media
=== sectors ===
==== tourism ====
according to unep global tourism is closely linked to climate change tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere tourism accounts for about 50% of traffic movements rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5% of the production of co2 the number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020 adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions
==== road haulage ====
the road haulage industry plays a part in production of co2 contributing around 20% of the uks total carbon emissions a year with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39% average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are fallingin the thirty-year period from 19772007 the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent nox emissions are also down 87 percent whereas journey times have fallen by around a third due to their size hgvs often receive criticism regarding their co2 emissions however rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect
== role of water vapor ==
water vapor accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when including clouds water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally but human activity does not significantly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales such as near irrigated fields the atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature from less than 0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass at in saturated air at about 32 c (see relative humidity#other important facts.)
the average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as ch
4 and co2 thus water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases the clausiusclapeyron relation establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures this and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor (assuming that the relative humidity remains approximately constant modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so) because water vapor is a greenhouse gas this results in further warming and so is a positive feedback that amplifies the original warming eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of earth's water through a venus-like runaway greenhouse effect
== direct greenhouse gas emissions ==
between the period 1970 to 2004 ghg emissions (measured in co2-equivalent) increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year with co2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9% per year total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes co2-equivalent these emissions include co2 from fossil fuel use and from land use as well as emissions of methane nitrous oxide and other ghgs covered by the kyoto protocol
at present the primary source of co2 emissions is the burning of coal natural gas and petroleum for electricity and heat
=== regional and national attribution of emissions ===
there are several different ways of measuring ghg emissions for example see world bank (2010) for tables of national emissions data some variables that have been reported include
definition of measurement boundaries emissions can be attributed geographically to the area where they were emitted (the territory principle) or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions these two principles result in different totals when measuring for example electricity importation from one country to another or emissions at an international airport
time horizon of different ghgs contribution of a given ghg is reported as a co2 equivalent the calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere this is not always known accurately and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information
what sectors are included in the calculation (e.g. energy industries industrial processes agriculture etc.) there is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data
the measurement protocol itself this may be via direct measurement or estimation the four main methods are the emission factor-based method mass balance method predictive emissions monitoring systems and continuous emissions monitoring systems these methods differ in accuracy cost and usability
these different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy/ethical positions on climate change (banuri et al. 1996 p 94) this use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets there are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool or at least the development of communication between different tools
emissions may be measured over long time periods this measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of ghgs (iea 2007 p 199)
the national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions the national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports for many richer nations such as the united states the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported this is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods we believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(holtz-eakin 1995 pp.;85;101)
emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods emissions changes may for example be measured against a base year of 1990 1990 was used in the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) as the base year for emissions and is also used in the kyoto protocol (some gases are also measured from the year 1995) a country's emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year
another measurement is of per capita emissions this divides a country's total annual emissions by its mid-year population per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions (banuri et al. 1996 pp 106107)
=== land-use change ===
land-use change e.g. the clearing of forests for agricultural use can affect the concentration of ghgs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure net emissions i.e. gross emissions from all ghg sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks (banuri et al. 1996 pp 9293)
there are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions additionally there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time (banuri et al. 1996 p 93) for instance concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier e.g. europe
=== greenhouse gas intensity ===
greenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric e.g. gross domestic product (gdp) or energy use the terms carbon intensity and emissions intensity are also sometimes used ghg intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates (mer) or purchasing power parity (ppp) (banuri et al. 1996 p 96) calculations based on mer show large differences in intensities between developed and developing countries whereas calculations based on ppp show smaller differences
=== cumulative and historical emissions ===
cumulative anthropogenic (i.e. human-emitted) emissions of co2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change
the table above to the left is based on banuri et al (1996 p 94) overall developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial co2 emissions over this time period and 67.8% of total co2 emissions developing countries accounted for industrial co2 emissions of 16.2% over this time period and 32.2% of total co2 emissions the estimate of total co2 emissions includes biotic carbon emissions mainly from deforestation banuri et al (1996 p 94) calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population the ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1
including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change (banuri et al. 1996 pp 9394) the actual calculation of net emissions is very complex and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system
non-oecd countries accounted for 42% of cumulative energy-related co2 emissions between 18902007 over this time period the us accounted for 28% of emissions the eu 23% russia 11% china 9% other oecd countries 5% japan 4% india 3% and the rest of the world 18%
=== changes since a particular base year ===
between 19702004 global growth in annual co2 emissions was driven by north america asia and the middle east the sharp acceleration in co2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2 ppm per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations china was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the soviet union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported in comparison methane has not increased appreciably and n
2o by 0.25% y1
using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming this can be calculated by dividing a country's highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year by that country's minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year choosing between different base years of 1750 1900 1950 and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries within the g8 group of countries it is most significant for the uk france and germany these countries have a long history of co2 emissions (see the section on cumulative and historical emissions)
=== annual emissions ===
annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries due to china's fast economic development its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the annex i group of the kyoto protocol (i.e. the developed countries excluding the usa) other countries with fast growing emissions are south korea iran and australia on the other hand annual per capita emissions of the eu-15 and the usa are gradually decreasing over time emissions in russia and the ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries
energy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for the industrialized countries for china's annual emissions in 2008 the netherlands environmental assessment agency estimated an uncertainty range of about 10%
the ghg footprint or greenhouse gas footprint refers to the amount of ghg that are emitted during the creation of products or services it is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint which measures only carbon dioxide one of many greenhouse gases
=== top emitter countries ===
==== annual ====
in 2009 the annual top ten emitting countries accounted for about two-thirds of the world's annual energy-related co2 emissions
==== cumulative ====
=== embedded emissions ===
one way of attributing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions is to measure the embedded emissions (also referred to as embodied emissions") of goods that are being consumed emissions are usually measured according to production rather than consumption for example in the main international treaty on climate change (the unfccc) countries report on emissions produced within their borders e.g. the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels under a production-based accounting of emissions embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting rather than the importing country under a consumption-based accounting of emissions embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country rather than the exporting country
davis and caldeira (2010) found that a substantial proportion of co2 emissions are traded internationally the net effect of trade was to export emissions from china and other emerging markets to consumers in the us japan and western europe based on annual emissions data from the year 2004 and on a per-capita consumption basis the top-5 emitting countries were found to be (in tco2 per person per year) luxembourg (34.7) the us (22.0) singapore (20.2) australia (16.7) and canada (16.6) carbon trust research revealed that approximately 25% of all co2 emissions from human activities flow (i.e are imported or exported) from one country to another major developed economies were found to be typically net importers of embodied carbon emissions with uk consumption emissions 34% higher than production emissions and germany (29%) japan (19%) and the usa (13%) also significant net importers of embodied emissions
=== effect of policy ===
governments have taken action to reduce ghg emissions (climate change mitigation) assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by the intergovernmental panel on climate change international energy agency and united nations environment programme policies implemented by governments have included national and regional targets to reduce emissions promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable energy
countries and regions listed in annex i of the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) (i.e. the oecd and former planned economies of the soviet union) are required to submit periodic assessments to the unfccc of actions they are taking to address climate change analysis by the unfccc (2011) suggested that policies and measures undertaken by annex i parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq in the year 2010 with most savings made in the energy sector the projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq is measured against a hypothetical baseline of annex i emissions i.e. projected annex i emissions in the absence of policies and measures the total projected annex i saving of 1.5 thousand co2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the annex i parties
=== projections ===
a wide range of projections of future ghg emissions have been produced rogner et al (2007) assessed the scientific literature on ghg projections rogner et al (2007) concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 20252030 projections suggest that more than 80% of the world's energy will come from fossil fuels this conclusion was based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature projected annual energy-related co2 emissions in 2030 were 40110% higher than in 2000 with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower (2.85.1 tonnes co2) than those in developed country regions (9.615.1 tonnes co2) projections consistently showed increase in annual world ghg emissions (the kyoto gases measured in co2-equivalent) of 2590% by 2030 compared to 2000
=== relative co2 emission from various fuels ===
one liter of gasoline when used as a fuel produces 2.32 kg (about 1300 liters or 1.3 cubic meters) of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas one us gallon produces 19.4 lb (1,291.5 gallons or 172.65 cubic feet)
== life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources ==
a literature review of numerous energy sources co2 emissions by the ipcc in 2011 found that the co2 emission value that fell within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies conducted was as follows
== removal from the atmosphere ("sinks") ==
=== natural processes ===
greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes as a consequence of
a physical change (condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere)
a chemical reaction within the atmosphere for example methane is oxidized by reaction with naturally occurring hydroxyl radical oh and degraded to co2 and water vapor (co2 from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane global warming potential) other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols
a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet an example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans
a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet this is the case for co2 which is reduced by photosynthesis of plants and which after dissolving in the oceans reacts to form carbonic acid and bicarbonate and carbonate ions (see ocean acidification)
a photochemical change halocarbons are dissociated by uv light releasing cl and f as free radicals in the stratosphere with harmful effects on ozone (halocarbons are generally too stable to disappear by chemical reaction in the atmosphere)
=== negative emissions ===
a number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide air capture or to the soil as in the case with biochar the ipcc has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change
== history of scientific research ==

2 do not absorb infrared radiation (called at that time dark radiation") while water (both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds) and co2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation in the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them during the late 20th century a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system with consequences for the environment and for human health
