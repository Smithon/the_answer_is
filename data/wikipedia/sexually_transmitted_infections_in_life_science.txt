sexually transmitted infections (sti) also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (std) and venereal diseases (vd) are infections that are commonly spread by sex especially vaginal intercourse anal sex and oral sex most stis initially do not cause symptoms this results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge penile discharge ulcers on or around the genitals and pelvic pain stis acquired before or during birth may result in poor outcomes for the baby some stis may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant
more than 30 different bacteria viruses and parasites can cause stis bacterial stis include chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis among others viral stis include genital herpes hiv/aids and genital warts among others parasitic stis include trichomoniasis among others while usually spread by sex some stis can also be spread by non-sexual contact with contaminated blood and tissues breastfeeding or during childbirth sti diagnostic tests are easily available in the developed world but this is often not the case in the developing world
the most effective way of preventing stis is by not having sex some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis b and some types of hpv safer sex practices such as use of condoms having a smaller number of sexual partners and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections most stis are treatable or curable of the most common infections syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia trichomoniasis are curable while herpes hepatitis b hiv/aids and hpv are treatable but not curable resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea
in 2008 it was estimated that 500 million people were infected with either syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia or trichomoniasis at least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus stis other than hiv resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013 in the united states there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010 historical documentation of stis date back to at least the ebers papyrus around 1550 bc and the old testament there is often shame and stigma associated with these infections the term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over the terms sexually transmitted disease and venereal disease as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease
== classificationedit ==
until the 1990s stis were commonly known as venereal diseases the word venereal being derived from the latin word venereus and meaning relating to sexual intercourse or desire ultimately derived from venus the roman goddess of love "social disease" was a phrase used as a euphemism
the world health organization (who) has recommended sexually transmitted infection as the preferred term since 1999 sexually transmitted infection is a broader term than sexually transmitted disease an infection is a colonization by a parasitic species which may not cause any adverse effects in a disease the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function in either case the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms increased understanding of infections like hpv which infects a significant portion of sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few has led to increased use of the term sti public health officials originally introduced the term sexually transmitted infection which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually transmitted disease in order to distinguish it from the former
std may refer only to infections that are causing diseases or it may be used more loosely as a synonym for sti most of the time people do not know that they are infected with an sti until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease moreover the term sexually transmissible disease is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission for instance meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an sti because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis this discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact in general an sti is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated meansblood transfusion sharing of hypodermic needlesare not taken into account) thus one may presume that if a person is infected with an sti e.g. chlamydia gonorrhea genital herpes hpv it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact
== signs and symptomsedit ==
not all stis are symptomatic and symptoms may not appear immediately after infection in some instances a disease can be carried with no symptoms which leaves a greater risk of passing the disease on to others depending on the disease some untreated stis can lead to infertility chronic pain or even death
== causeedit ==
=== transmissionedit ===
the risks and transmission probabilities of sexually transmitted diseases are summarized by act in the table:
=== bacterialedit ===
chancroid (haemophilus ducreyi)
chlamydia (chlamydia trachomatis)
gonorrhea (neisseria gonorrhoeae) colloquially known as "the clap"
granuloma inguinale or (klebsiella granulomatis)
mycoplasma genitalium
mycoplasma hominis
syphilis (treponema pallidum)
ureaplasma infection
=== fungaledit ===
candidiasis (yeast infection)
=== viraledit ===
viral hepatitis (hepatitis b virus)saliva venereal fluids
(note: hepatitis a and hepatitis e are transmitted via the fecal-oral route; hepatitis c is rarely sexually transmittable and the route of transmission of hepatitis d (only if infected with b) is uncertain but may include sexual transmission.)
herpes simplex (herpes simplex virus 1 2) skin and mucosal transmissible with or without visible blisters
hiv (human immunodeficiency virus)venereal fluids semen breast milk blood
hpv (human papillomavirus)skin and mucosal contact 'high risk' types of hpv cause almost all cervical cancers as well as some anal penile and vulvar cancer some other types of hpv cause genital warts
molluscum contagiosum (molluscum contagiosum virus mcv)close contact
=== parasitesedit ===
crab louse colloquially known as "crabs" or "pubic lice" (pthirus pubis)
scabies (sarcoptes scabiei)
=== protozoaledit ===
trichomoniasis (trichomonas vaginalis) colloquially known as "trich"
=== main typesedit ===
sexually transmitted infections include:
chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis in women symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge burning during urination and bleeding in between periods although most women do not experience any symptoms symptoms in men include pain when urinating and abnormal discharge from their penis if left untreated in both men and women chlamydia can infect the urinary tract and potentially lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) pid can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even has the potential to cause infertility it can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy in which the child is born outside of the uterus however chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics
the two most common forms of herpes are caused by infection with herpes simplex virus (hsv) hsv-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores hsv-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals however either strain may affect either site some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters headaches backaches itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area pain during urination flu like symptoms swollen glands or fever herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus the virus affects the areas where it entered the body this can occur through kissing vaginal intercourse oral sex or anal sex the virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact the primary attack is the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up after the primary attack one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks there is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (valtrex) although hsv-1 is typically the "oral" version of the virus and hsv-2 is typically the "genital" version of the virus a person with hsv-1 orally can transmit that virus to their partner genitally the virus either type will settle into a nerve bundle either at the top of the spine producing the "oral" outbreak or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine producing the genital outbreak
the human papillomavirus (hpv) is the most common sti in the united states there are more than 40 different strands of hpv and many do not cause any health problems in 90% of cases the bodys immune system clears the infection naturally within 2 years some cases may not be cleared and can lead to genital warts (bumps around the genitals that can be small or large raised or flat or shaped like cauliflower) or cervical cancer and other hpv related cancers symptoms might not show up until advanced stages it is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers there are also two vaccines available for women (cervarix and gardasil) that protect against the types of hpv that cause cervical cancer hpv can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex it is important to remember that the infected partner might not have any symptoms
gonorrhea is caused by bacterium that lives on moist mucous membranes in the urethra vagina rectum mouth throat and eyes the infection can spread through contact with the penis vagina mouth or anus symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 to 5 days after contact with an infected partner however some men might not notice symptoms for up to a month symptoms in men include burning and pain while urinating increased urinary frequency discharge from the penis (white green or yellow in color) red or swollen urethra swollen or tender testicles or sore throat symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge burning or itching while urinating painful sexual intercourse severe pain in lower abdomen (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes) or fever (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes) however many women do not show any symptoms there are some antibiotic resistant strains for gonorrhea but most cases can be cured with antibiotics
syphilis is an sti caused by a bacterium untreated it can lead to complications and death clinical manifestations of syphilis include the ulceration of the uro-genital tract mouth or rectum; if left untreated the symptoms worsen in recent years the prevalence of syphilis has declined in western europe but it has increased in eastern europe (former soviet states) a high incidence of syphilis can be found in places such as cameroon cambodia papua new guinea syphilis infections are increasing in the united states
trichomoniasis is a common sti that is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called trichomonas vaginalis trichomoniasis affects both women and men but symptoms are more common in women most patients are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole which is very effective
hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) damages the body's immune system which interferes with its ability to fight off disease-causing agents the virus kills cd4 cells which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections hiv is carried in body fluids and is spread by sexual activity it can also be spread by contact with infected blood breast feeding childbirth and from mother to child during pregnancy when hiv is at its most advanced stage an individual is said to have aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) there are different stages of the progression of and hiv infection the stages include primary infection asymptomatic infection symptomatic infection and aids in the primary infection stage an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache fatigue fever muscle aches) for about 2 weeks in the asymptomatic stage symptoms usually disappear and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years when hiv progresses to the symptomatic stage the immune system is weakened and has a low cell count of cd4+ t cells when the hiv infection becomes life-threatening it is called aids people with aids fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result when the disease was first discovered in the 1980s those who had aids were not likely to live longer than a few years there are now antiretroviral drugs (arvs) available to treat hiv infections there is no known cure for hiv or aids but the drugs help suppress the virus by suppressing the amount of virus in the body people can lead longer and healthier lives even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others
=== unscreenededit ===
there are many species of bacteria protozoa fungi and viruses many which remain undocumented or poorly studied with regards to sexual transmission despite that the above include what are generally known as stis sexually transmission of microbes is far from limited to the above list since the sexual route of transmission is not considered common and/or the microbe itself is not implicated in a major research study on disease the following pathogens are simply not screened for in sexual health clinics some of these microbes are known to be sexually transmittable
microbes known to be sexually transmissible (but not generally considered stds/stis) include:
marburg virus - virus in semen for 7 weeks after clinical recovery
htlv (both types 1 and 2) - sexually transmissible consumption of breast milk breastfeeding and once mistaken as a hiv risk of leukemia
== pathophysiologyedit ==
many stis are (more easily) transmitted through the mucous membranes of the penis vulva rectum urinary tract and (less oftendepending on type of infection) the mouth throat respiratory tract and eyes the visible membrane covering the head of the penis is a mucous membrane though it produces no mucus (similar to the lips of the mouth) mucous membranes differ from skin in that they allow certain pathogens into the body the amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane
this is one reason that the probability of transmitting many infections is far higher from sex than by more casual means of transmission such as non-sexual contacttouching hugging shaking handsbut it is not the only reason although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals many stis seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing according to a safe sex chart many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another with hiv genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva some infections labeled as stis can be transmitted by direct skin contact herpes simplex and hpv are both examples kshv on the other hand may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used as a sexual lubricant
depending on the sti a person may still be able to spread the infection if no signs of disease are present for example a person is much more likely to spread herpes infection when blisters are present than when they are absent however a person can spread hiv infection at any time even if he/she has not developed symptoms of aids
all sexual behaviors that involve contact with the bodily fluids of another person should be considered to contain some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases most attention has focused on controlling hiv which causes aids but each sti presents a different situation
as may be noted from the name sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted from one person to another by certain sexual activities rather than being actually caused by those sexual activities bacteria fungi protozoa or viruses are still the causative agents it is not possible to catch any sexually transmitted disease from a sexual activity with a person who is not carrying a disease; conversely a person who has an sti got it from contact (sexual or otherwise) with someone who had it or his/her bodily fluids some stis such as hiv can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding
although the likelihood of transmitting various diseases by various sexual activities varies a great deal in general all sexual activities between two (or more) people should be considered as being a two-way route for the transmission of stis i.e. "giving" or "receiving" are both risky although receiving carries a higher risk
healthcare professionals suggest safer sex such as the use of condoms as the most reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity but safer sex should by no means be considered an absolute safeguard the transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids such as blood transfusions and other blood products sharing injection needles needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures) sharing tattoo needles and childbirth are other avenues of transmission these different means put certain groups such as medical workers and haemophiliacs and drug users particularly at risk
recent epidemiological studies have investigated the networks that are defined by sexual relationships between individuals and discovered that the properties of sexual networks are crucial to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in particular assortative mixing between people with large numbers of sexual partners seems to be an important factor
it is possible to be an asymptomatic carrier of sexually transmitted diseases in particular sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease
== preventionedit ==
prevention is key in addressing incurable stis such as hiv and herpes sexual health clinics promote the use of condoms and provide outreach for at-risk communities
the most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of stis is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk although a condom is effective in limiting exposure some disease transmission may occur even with a condom
both partners should get tested for stis before initiating sexual contact or before resuming contact if a partner engaged in contact with someone else many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate certain stis particularly certain persistent viruses like hpv may be impossible to detect with current medical procedures
many diseases that establish permanent infections can so occupy the immune system that other diseases become more easily transmitted the innate immune system led by defensins against hiv can prevent transmission of hiv when viral counts are very low but if busy with other viruses or overwhelmed hiv can establish itself certain viral sti's also greatly increase the risk of death for hiv infected patients
strategies to increase testing for hiv and stis have proved to be successful some treatment facilities utilize in-home test kits and have the person return the test for follow-up other facilities strongly encourage that those previously infected return to ensure that the infection has been eliminated novel strategies to foster re-testing have been the use of text messaging and email as reminders these types of reminders are now used in addition to phone calls and letters
=== vaccinesedit ===
vaccines are available that protect against some viral stis such as hepatitis a hepatitis b and some types of hpv vaccination before initiation of sexual contact is advised to assure maximal protection
=== condomsedit ===
condoms and female condoms only provide protection when used properly as a barrier and only to and from the area that it covers uncovered areas are still susceptible to many stis
in the case of hiv sexual transmission routes almost always involve the penis as hiv cannot spread through unbroken skin; therefore properly shielding the penis with a properly worn condom from the vagina or anus effectively stops hiv transmission an infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of hiv would not be considered "sexually transmitted" but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact this can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when presenting open bleeding wounds
other stis even viral infections can be prevented with the use of latex polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms as a barrier some microorganisms and viruses are small enough to pass through the pores in natural skin condoms but are still too large to pass through latex or synthetic condoms
proper male condom usage entails:
not putting the condom on too tight at the end and leaving 1.5 cm (3/4 inch) room at the tip for ejaculation putting the condom on snug can and often does lead to failure
wearing a condom too loose can defeat the barrier
avoiding inverting or spilling a condom once worn whether it has ejaculate in it or not
if a user attempts to unroll the condom but realizes they have it on the wrong side then this condom should be discarded
being careful with the condom if handling it with long nails
avoiding the use of oil-based lubricants (or anything with oil in it) with latex condoms as oil can eat holes into them
using flavored condoms for oral sex only as the sugar in the flavoring can lead to yeast infections if used to penetrate
in order to best protect oneself and the partner from stis the old condom and its contents should be assumed to be infectious therefore the old condom must be properly disposed of a new condom should be used for each act of intercourse as multiple usage increases the chance of breakage defeating the effectiveness as a barrier
=== nonoxynol-9edit ===
researchers had hoped that nonoxynol-9 a vaginal microbicide would help decrease sti risk trials however have found it ineffective and it may put women at a higher risk of hiv infection
== screeningedit ==
sexually active women under the age of 25 and those over 25 with risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly after being treated for gonorrhea all people should be re tested for the disease after three months
nucleic acid amplification tests are the recommended method of diagnosis for gonorrhea and chlamydia this can be done on either urine in both men and women vaginal or cervical swabs in women or urethral swabs in men
== diagnosisedit ==
testing may be for a single infection or consist of a number of tests for a range of stis including tests for syphilis trichomonas gonorrhea chlamydia herpes hepatitis and hiv no procedure tests for all infectious agents
sti tests may be used for a number of reasons:
as a diagnostic test to determine the cause of symptoms or illness
as a screening test to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections
as a check that prospective sexual partners are free of disease before they engage in sex without safer sex precautions (for example when starting a long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship in fluid bonding or for procreation)
as a check prior to or during pregnancy to prevent harm to the baby
as a check after birth to check that the baby has not caught an sti from the mother
to prevent the use of infected donated blood or organs
as part of the process of contact tracing from a known infected individual
as part of mass epidemiological surveillance
early identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment there is often a window period after initial infection during which an sti test will be negative during this period the infection may be transmissible the duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional one report indicated that people turn to the internet rather than to a medical professional for information on stis to a higher degree than for other sexual problems
== managementedit ==
high-risk exposure such as that which occurs in rape cases may be treated preventatively using antibiotic combinations such as azithromycin cefixime and metronidazole
an option for treating partners of patients (index cases) diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is patient-delivered partner therapy which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner
== epidemiologyedit ==
std incidence rates remain high in most of the world despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances that can rapidly render patients with many stds noninfectious and cure most in many cultures changing sexual morals and oral contraceptive use have eliminated traditional sexual restraints especially for women and both physicians and patients have difficulty dealing openly and candidly with sexual issues additionally development and spread of drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. penicillin-resistant gonococci) makes some stds harder to cure the effect of travel is most dramatically illustrated by the rapid spread of the aids virus (hiv-1) from africa to europe and the americas in the late 1970s
commonly reported prevalences of stis among sexually active adolescent girls both with and without lower genital tract symptoms include chlamydia (1025%) gonorrhea (318%) syphilis (03%) trichomonas vaginalis (816%) and herpes simplex virus (212%) among adolescent boys with no symptoms of urethritis isolation rates include chlamydia (911%) and gonorrhea (23%) a 2008 cdc study found that 2540% of u.s teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease
aids is among the leading causes of death in present-day sub-saharan africa hiv/aids is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse more than 1.1 million persons are living with hiv/aids in the united states and it disproportionately impacts african americans hepatitis b is also considered a sexually transmitted disease because it can be spread through sexual contact the highest rates are found in asia and africa and lower rates are in the americas and europe approximately two billion people worldwide have been infected with the hepatitis b virus
== historyedit ==
the first well-recorded european outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out among french troops besieging naples in the italian war of 149498 the disease may have originated from the columbian exchange from naples the disease swept across europe killing more than five million people as jared diamond describes it "[w]hen syphilis was first definitely recorded in europe in 1495 its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees caused flesh to fall from people's faces and led to death within a few months," rendering it far more fatal than it is today diamond concludes,"[b]y 1546 the disease had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today."
prior to the invention of modern medicines sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable and treatment was limited to treating the symptoms of the disease the first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at london lock hospital treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century the contagious diseases acts were used to arrest suspected prostitutes in 1924 a number of states concluded the brussels agreement whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases
the first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was salvarsan a treatment for syphilis with the discovery of antibiotics a large number of sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable and this combined with effective public health campaigns against stds led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat
during this period the importance of contact tracing in treating stis was recognized by tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals testing them for infection treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn sti clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population
in the 1980s first genital herpes and then aids emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine aids in particular has a long asymptomatic periodduring which time hiv (the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to othersfollowed by a symptomatic period which leads rapidly to death unless treated hiv/aids entered the united states from haiti in about 1969 recognition that aids threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow aids to be managed by suppressing the replication of hiv for as long as possible contact tracing continues to be an important measure even when diseases are incurable as it helps to contain infection
