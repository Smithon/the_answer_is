medicine (british english /mdsn/ american english /mdsn/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease the word medicine is derived from latin medicus meaning a physician medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness
contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences biomedical research genetics and medical technology to diagnose treat and prevent injury and disease typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy external splints and traction medical devices biologics and ionizing radiation amongst others
medicine has existed for thousands of years during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture for example a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism in recent centuries since the advent of science most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied under the umbrella of medical science) while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science
prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine they remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine for example evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is variable and inconsistent for any condition but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner in contrast treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery
== clinical practice ==
medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the western world while in developing countries such as parts of africa or asia the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners even in the developed world however evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice for example a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm
in modern clinical practice doctors personally assess patients in order to diagnose treat and prevent disease using clinical judgment the doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record followed by a medical interview and a physical examination basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g stethoscope tongue depressor) are typically used after examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms the doctor may order medical tests (e.g blood tests) take a biopsy or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided during the encounter properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust the medical encounter is then documented in the medical record which is a legal document in many jurisdictions follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure and specialists follow a similar process the diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue
the components of the medical interview and encounter are
chief complaint (cc) the reason for the current medical visit these are the symptoms. they are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one also called presenting complaint
history of present illness/complaint (hpi) the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom
current activity occupation hobbies what the patient actually does
medications (rx) what drugs the patient takes including prescribed over-the-counter and home remedies as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies allergies are also recorded
past medical history (pmh/pmhx) concurrent medical problems past hospitalizations and operations injuries past infectious diseases and/or vaccinations history of known allergies
social history (sh) birthplace residences marital history social and economic status habits (including diet medications tobacco alcohol)
family history (fh) listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient a family tree is sometimes used
review of systems (ros) or systems inquiry a set of additional questions to ask which may be missed on hpi a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss change in sleep quality fevers lumps and bumps etc.) followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (heart lungs digestive tract urinary tract etc.)
the physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease which are objective and observable in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable the healthcare provider uses the senses of sight hearing touch and sometimes smell (e.g. in infection uremia diabetic ketoacidosis) four actions are the basis of physical examination inspection palpation (feel) percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics) and auscultation (listen) generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments
the clinical examination involves the study of
vital signs including height weight body temperature blood pressure pulse respiration rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation
general appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status presence of jaundice pallor or clubbing)
skin
head eye ear nose and throat (heent)
cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)
respiratory (large airways and lungs)
abdomen and rectum
genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)
neurological (consciousness awareness brain vision cranial nerves spinal cord and peripheral nerves)
psychiatric (orientation mental state evidence of abnormal perception or thought)
it is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above
the treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies starting therapy referral to a specialist or watchful observation follow-up may be advised depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system various forms of utilization review such as prior authorization of tests may place barriers on accessing expensive services
the medical decision-making (mdm) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses) along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem
on subsequent visits the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history symptoms physical findings and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations
== institutions ==
contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations such as churches the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided
from ancient times christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the catholic church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the united states) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance this is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics or by charities most commonly by a combination of all three
most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole in such societies healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly
transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and therefore the incentives of medical professionals while the us healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness new legislation may encourage greater openness there is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other
=== delivery ===
provision of medical care is classified into primary secondary and tertiary care categories
primary care medical services are provided by physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care these occur in physician offices clinics nursing homes schools home visits and other places close to patients about 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider these include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes
secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists these include both ambulatory care and inpatient services emergency rooms intensive care medicine surgery services physical therapy labor and delivery endoscopy units diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services hospice centers etc some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting
tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals these include trauma centers burn treatment centers advanced neonatology unit services organ transplants high-risk pregnancy radiation oncology etc
modern medical care also depends on information still delivered in many health care settings on paper records but increasingly nowadays by electronic means
in low-income countries modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person international healthcare policy researchers have advocated that user fees be removed in these areas to ensure access although even after removal significant costs and barriers remain
== branches ==
working together as an interdisciplinary team many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care examples include nurses emergency medical technicians and paramedics laboratory scientists pharmacists podiatrists physiotherapists respiratory therapists speech therapists occupational therapists radiographers dietitians and bioengineers surgeons surgeon's assistant surgical technologist
the scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields dentistry while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine is a medical field
a patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem e.g. the cardiology team who then may interact with other specialties e.g. surgical radiology to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments
physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine which are listed below there are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in
the main branches of medicine are
basic sciences of medicine this is what every physician is educated in and some return to in biomedical research
medical specialties
interdisciplinary fields where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions
=== basic sciences ===
anatomy is the study of the physical structure of organisms in contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures
biochemistry is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms especially the structure and function of their chemical components
biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of mechanics
biostatistics is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense a knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning evaluation and interpretation of medical research it is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine

radiobiology is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms
toxicology is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons
=== specialties ===
in the broadest meaning of medicine there are many different specialties in the uk most specialities have their own body or college which have its own entrance examination these are collectively known as the royal colleges although not all currently use the term royal the development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments) the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination
within medical circles specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories medicine and surgery. medicine refers to the practice of non-operative medicine and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in internal medicine in the uk this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the membership of the royal college of physicians (mrcp) or the equivalent college in scotland or ireland surgery refers to the practice of operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in general surgery which in the uk leads to membership of the royal college of surgeons of england (mrcs) at present some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories such as radiology pathology or anesthesia most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the royal college of surgeons (for which mrcs/frcs would have been required) before becoming the royal college of anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the fellowship of the royal college of anesthetists (frca)
==== surgical specialty ====
surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example a perforated ear drum) surgeons must also manage pre-operative post-operative and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards surgery has many sub-specialties including general surgery cardiovascular surgery colorectal surgery neurosurgery oral and maxillofacial surgery oncologic surgery orthopedic surgery otolaryngology plastic surgery podiatric surgery transplant surgery trauma surgery urology vascular surgery and pediatric surgery in some centers anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons) although it is not a surgical discipline other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures such as ophthalmology and dermatology but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se
surgical training in the u.s requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years in addition fellowships can last an additional one to three years because post-residency fellowships can be competitive many trainees devote two additional years to research thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school furthermore surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming
==== internal specialty ====
internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention diagnosis and treatment of adult diseases according to some sources an emphasis on internal structures is implied in north america specialists in internal medicine are commonly called internists. elsewhere especially in commonwealth nations such specialists are often called physicians these terms internist or physician (in the narrow sense common outside north america) generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics pathology psychiatry and especially surgery and its subspecialities
because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations internists do much of their work in hospitals formerly many internists were not subspecialized such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem this style of practice has become much less common in modern urban practice most internists are subspecialists that is they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge for example gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys
in the commonwealth of nations and some other countries specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system elsewhere especially in north america general pediatrics is often a form of primary care
there are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of internal medicine
training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training) varies considerably across the world see the articles on medical education and physician for more details in north america it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above in general resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery averaging about 60 hours per week in the usa this difference does not apply in the uk where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average
==== diagnostic specialties ====
clinical laboratory sciences are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients in the united states these services are supervised by a pathologist the personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree who actually perform the tests assays and procedures needed for providing the specific services subspecialties include transfusion medicine cellular pathology clinical chemistry hematology clinical microbiology and clinical immunology
pathology as a medical specialty is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic physiologic changes produced by them as a diagnostic specialty pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence-based medicine many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry polymerase chain reaction (pcr) immunohistochemistry cytogenetics gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) fall within the territory of pathology
radiology is concerned with imaging of the human body e.g by x-rays x-ray computed tomography ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography
nuclear medicine is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a pet scanner each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g. neurotransmitter pathway metabolic pathway blood flow or other) and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter) there is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the pet/ct scanner
clinical neurophysiology is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system these kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity or (2) stimulus evoked responses subspecialties include electroencephalography electromyography evoked potential nerve conduction study and polysomnography sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional
==== other major specialties ====
the followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups
anesthesiology (also known as anaesthetics) concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient the anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs (i.e brain heart kidneys) functions and postoperative pain outside of the operating room the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor & delivery ward and some are specialized in critical medicine
dermatology is concerned with the skin and its diseases in the uk dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine
emergency medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions including trauma surgical medical pediatric and psychiatric emergencies
family medicine family practice general practice or primary care is in many countries the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices emergency room coverage inpatient care and nursing home care
obstetrics and gynecology (often abbreviated as ob/gyn (american english) or obs & gynae (british english)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists
medical genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders
neurology is concerned with diseases of the nervous system in the uk neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine
ophthalmology is exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa combining conservative and surgical therapy
pediatrics (ae) or paediatrics (be) is devoted to the care of infants children and adolescents like internal medicine there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges organ systems disease classes and sites of care delivery

hospice and palliative medicine is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure
hospital medicine is the general medical care of hospitalized patients physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the usa and canada the term most responsible physician (mrp) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role
laser medicine involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics and/or treatment of various conditions
medical humanities includes the humanities (literature philosophy ethics history and religion) social science (anthropology cultural studies psychology sociology) and the arts (literature theater film and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice
health informatics is a relatively recent field that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine
nosology is the classification of diseases for various purposes
nosokinetics is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems
occupational medicine's principal role is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained

pharmacogenomics is a form of individualized medicine
podiatric medicine is the study of diagnosis and medical treatment of disorders of the foot ankle lower limb hip and lower back
sexual medicine is concerned with diagnosing assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality
sports medicine deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as muscle spasms muscle tears injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in athletes amateur and professional
therapeutics is the field more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health
travel medicine or emporiatrics deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments
tropical medicine deals with the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases it is studied separately in temperate climates where those diseases are quite unfamiliar to medical practitioners and their local clinical needs
urgent care focuses on delivery of unscheduled walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department in some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room
veterinary medicine veterinarians apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals
wilderness medicine entails the practice of medicine in the wild where conventional medical facilities may not be available
many other health science fields e.g dietetics
== education ==
medical education and training varies around the world it typically involves entry level education at a university medical school followed by a period of supervised practice or internship and/or residency this can be followed by postgraduate vocational training a variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education still itself a focus of active research in canada and the united states of america a doctor of medicine degree often abbreviated m.d. or a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree often abbreviated as d.o and unique to the united states must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university
since knowledge techniques and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways including medical journals seminars conferences and online programs
== medical ethics ==
medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine as a scholarly discipline medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history philosophy theology and sociology six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are
autonomy - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment (voluntas aegroti suprema lex.)
beneficence - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient (salus aegroti suprema lex.)
justice - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality)
non-maleficence - first do no harm (primum non-nocere)
respect for persons - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity
truthfulness and honesty - the concept of informed consent has increased in importance since the historical events of the doctors trial of the nuremberg trials tuskegee syphilis experiment and others
values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts when moral values are in conflict the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis sometimes no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists and occasionally the values of the medical community (i.e. the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient family or larger non-medical community conflicts can also arise between health care providers or among family members for example some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions considering them life-saving and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the hiv era
== legal controls ==
in most countries it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered in general this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization which may ask the applicant to pass exams this restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards it is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain while the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in evidence based western or hippocratic medicine they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health
in the european union the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated a profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification the regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the eu member states eea countries and switzerland this list is covered by the directive 2005/36/ec
doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil criminal or professional sanctions
== criticism of modern medicine ==
a major problem for modern medicine has been lack of access in poor regions there is an outcome gap between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like aids and tuberculosis the majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich low-incidence regions such as the west on the other hand countries in the developing world have high rates of hiv but lack the necessary resources to treat them
medical errors and overmedication and other forms of iatrogenesis (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one superhuman individual and expect him or her not to make errors reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice clinical versus statistical algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by paul e meehl which found statistical methods superior a 2000 meta-analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or mechanical diagnostic methods were in general although not always superior
disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy for example elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study rural poor african-american men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care
== honors and awards ==
the highest honor awarded in medicine is the nobel prize in physiology or medicine awarded since 1901 by the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet
== history ==
=== ancient world ===
prehistoric medicine incorporated plants (herbalism) animal parts and minerals in many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests shamans or medicine men well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits) spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits) shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers) and divination (magically obtaining the truth) the field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health health care and related issues
early records on medicine have been discovered from ancient egyptian medicine babylonian medicine ayurvedic medicine (in the indian subcontinent) classical chinese medicine (predecessor to the modern traditional chinese medicine) and ancient greek medicine and roman medicine
in egypt imhotep (3rd millennium bc) is the first physician in history known by name the oldest egyptian medical text is the kahun gynaecological papyrus from around 2000 bce which describes gynaecological diseases the edwin smith papyrus dating back to 1600 bce is an early work on surgery while the ebers papyrus dating back to 1500 bce is akin to a textbook on medicine
in china archaeological evidence of medicine in chinese dates back to the bronze age shang dynasty based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery the huangdi neijing the progenitor of chinese medicine is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century bce and compiled in the 3rd century
in india the surgeon sushruta described numerous surgical operations including the earliest forms of plastic surgery earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from mihintale in sri lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found
in greece the greek physician hippocrates the father of medicine laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine hippocrates introduced the hippocratic oath for physicians which is still relevant and in use today and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute chronic endemic and epidemic and use terms such as exacerbation relapse resolution crisis paroxysm peak and convalescence the greek physician galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations including brain and eye surgeries after the fall of the western roman empire and the onset of the early middle ages the greek tradition of medicine went into decline in western europe although it continued uninterrupted in the eastern roman (byzantine) empire
most of our knowledge of ancient hebrew medicine during the 1st millennium bc comes from the torah i.e the five books of moses which contain various health related laws and rituals the hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the byzantine era with the physician asaph the jew
=== middle ages ===
after 750 ce the muslim world had the works of hippocrates galen and sushruta translated into arabic and islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research notable islamic medical pioneers include the persian polymath avicenna who along with imhotep and hippocrates has also been called the father of medicine he wrote the canon of medicine considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine others include abulcasis avenzoar ibn al-nafis and averroes rhazes was one of first to question the greek theory of humorism which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval western and medieval islamic medicine al-risalah al-dhahabiah by ali al-ridha the eighth imam of shia muslims is revered as the most precious islamic literature in the science of medicine the islamic bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals
in europe charlemagne decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian geoffrey blainey likened the activities of the catholic church in health care during the middle ages to an early version of a welfare state it conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young hospices for the sick of all ages places for the lepers and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal it supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor this welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates the benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts as at the great abbey of cluny the church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied the schola medica salernitana in salerno looking to the learning of greek and arab physicians grew to be the finest medical school in medieval europe
however the fourteenth and fifteenth century black death devastated both the middle east and europe and it has even been argued that western europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the middle east in the early modern period important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in europe including gabriele falloppio and william harvey
the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection especially during the black death in the 14th and 15th centuries of what may be called the traditional authority approach to science and medicine this was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so then that was the way it was and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in european society in general see copernicus's rejection of ptolemy's theories on astronomy) physicians like vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past the main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were materia medica and pharmacopoeia
andreas vesalius was the author of de humani corporis fabrica an important book on human anatomy bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by antonie van leeuwenhoek in 1676 initiating the scientific field microbiology independently from ibn al-nafis michael servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the manuscript of paris in 1546 and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553 later this was described by renaldus columbus and andrea cesalpino herman boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a father of physiology due to his exemplary teaching in leiden and textbook institutiones medicae (1708) pierre fauchard has been called the father of modern dentistry
=== modern ===
veterinary medicine was for the first time truly separated from human medicine in 1761 when the french veterinarian claude bourgelat founded the world's first veterinary school in lyon france before this medical doctors treated both humans and other animals
modern scientific biomedical research (where results are testable and reproducible) began to replace early western traditions based on herbalism the greek four humours and other such pre-modern notions the modern era really began with edward jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of inoculation earlier practiced in asia) robert koch's discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria and then the discovery of antibiotics around 1900
the post-18th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from europe from germany and austria doctors rudolf virchow wilhelm conrad rntgen karl landsteiner and otto loewi made notable contributions in the united kingdom alexander fleming joseph lister francis crick and florence nightingale are considered important spanish doctor santiago ramn y cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience

as science and technology developed medicine became more reliant upon medications throughout history and in europe right until the late 18th century not only animal and plant products were used as medicine but also human body parts and fluids pharmacology developed in part from herbalism and some drugs are still derived from plants (atropine ephedrine warfarin aspirin digoxin vinca alkaloids taxol hyoscine etc.) vaccines were discovered by edward jenner and louis pasteur
the first antibiotic was arsphenamine (salvarsan) discovered by paul ehrlich in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not the first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs derived by german chemists originally from azo dyes
pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side-effects genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic disorders have now been identified and the development of techniques in molecular biology and genetics are influencing medical technology practice and decision-making
evidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective algorithms of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis the movement is facilitated by modern global information science which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers the cochrane collaboration leads this movement a 2001 review of 160 cochrane systematic reviews revealed that according to two readers 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence 20% concluded evidence of no effect and 22.5% concluded positive effect
