a pharmaceutical drug (also referred to as a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical preparation pharmaceutical product medicinal product medicine medication medicament or simply a drug) is a drug used to diagnose cure treat or prevent disease drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management
drugs are classified in various ways one of the key divisions is by level of control which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician physician assistant or qualified nurse) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves) another key distinction is between traditional small molecule drugs usually derived from chemical synthesis and biopharmaceuticals which include recombinant proteins vaccines blood products used therapeutically (such as ivig) gene therapy and cell therapy (for instance stem cell therapies) other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action route of administration biological system affected or therapeutic effects an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system (atc system) the world health organization keeps a list of essential medicines
drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies academic scientists and governments governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed how drugs are marketed and in some jurisdictions drug pricing controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs
== definitionedit ==
in europe the term is medicinal product and it is defined by eu law as (a) any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings or
(b) any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological immunological or metabolic action or to making a medical diagnosis.
in the us a drug is
a substance recognized by an official pharmacopoeia or formulary
a substance intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease
a substance (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body
a substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component part or accessory of a device
biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process.)
== classificationedit ==
pharmaceutical or a drug is classified on the basis of their origin
drug from natural origin herbal or plant or mineral origin some drug substances are of marine origin
drug from chemical as well as natural origin derived from partial herbal and partial chemical synthesis chemical example steroidal drugs
drug derived from chemical synthesis
drug derived from animal origin for example hormones and enzymes
drug derived from microbial origin antibiotics
drug derived by biotechnology genetic-engineering hybridoma technique for example
drug derived from radioactive substances
one of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs usually derived from chemical synthesis and biologic medical products which include recombinant proteins vaccines blood products used therapeutically (such as ivig) gene therapy and cell therapy (for instance stem cell therapies)
pharmaceutical or drug or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity such as by chemical properties mode or route of administration biological system affected or therapeutic effects an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system (atc system) the world health organization keeps a list of essential medicines
a sampling of classes of medicine includes
antipyretics reducing fever (pyrexia/pyresis)
analgesics reducing pain (painkillers)
antimalarial drugs treating malaria
antibiotics inhibiting germ growth
antiseptics prevention of germ growth near burns cuts and wounds
mood stabilizers lithium and valpromide
hormone replacements premarin
oral contraceptives enovid biphasic pill and triphasic pill
stimulants methylphenidate amphetamine
tranquilizers meprobamate chlorpromazine reserpine chlordiazepoxide diazepam and alprazolam
statins lovastatin pravastatin and simvastatin
pharmaceuticals may also be described as specialty independent of other classifications which is an ill defined class of drugs that might be difficult to administer require special handling during administration require patient monitoring during and immediately after administration have particular regulatory requirements restricting their use and are generally expensive relative to other drugs

== administrationedit ==
administration is the process by which a patient takes a medicine there are three major categories of drug administration enteral (by mouth) parenteral (into the blood stream) and other (which includes giving a drug through intranasal topical inhalation and rectal means)
it can be performed in various dosage forms such as pills tablets or capsules
there are many variations in the routes of administration including intravenous (into the blood through a vein) and oral administration (through the mouth)
they can be administered all at once as a bolus at frequent intervals or continuously frequencies are often abbreviated from latin such as every 8 hours reading q8h from quaque viii hora
== drug discoveryedit ==
in the fields of medicine biotechnology and pharmacology drug discovery is the process by which new candidate drugs are discovered
historically drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery later chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy even more recently scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level and to use that knowledge to design (see drug design) drug candidates
modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity selectivity (to reduce the potential of side effects) efficacy/potency metabolic stability (to increase the half-life) and oral bioavailability once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials one or more of these steps may but not necessarily involve computer-aided drug design
despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems drug discovery is still a lengthy expensive difficult and inefficient process with low rate of new therapeutic discovery in 2010 the research and development cost of each new molecular entity (nme) was approximately us$1.8 billion drug discovery is done by pharmaceutical companies with research assistance from universities the final product of drug discovery is a patent on the potential drug the drug requires very expensive phase i ii and iii clinical trials and most of them fail small companies have a critical role often then selling the rights to larger companies that have the resources to run the clinical trials
== developmentedit ==
drug development is a blanket term used to define the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery it includes pre-clinical research (microorganisms/animals) and clinical trials (on humans) and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug
== regulationedit ==
the regulation of drugs varies by jurisdiction in some countries such as the united states they are regulated at the national level by a single agency in other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level or at both state and national levels by various bodies as is the case in australia the role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety quality and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation in most jurisdictions therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed there is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers
depending upon the jurisdiction drugs may be divided into over-the-counter drugs (otc) which may be available without special restrictions and prescription drugs which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner the precise distinction between otc and prescription depends on the legal jurisdiction a third category behind-the-counter drugs is implemented in some jurisdictions these do not require a prescription but must be kept in the dispensary not visible to the public and only be sold by a pharmacist or pharmacy technician doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for off-label use - purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency the classification of pharmaco-therapeutic referrals helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors
the international narcotics control board of the united nations imposes a world law of prohibition of certain drugs they publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden otc drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed many countries such as the united kingdom have a third category of pharmacy medicines which can only be sold in registered pharmacies by or under the supervision of a pharmacist
== drug pricingedit ==
in many jurisdictions drug prices are regulated
=== united kingdomedit ===
in the uk the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme is intended to ensure that the national health service is able to purchase drugs at reasonable prices
=== canadaedit ===
in canada the patented medicine prices review board examines drug pricing compares the proposed canadian price to that of seven other countries and determines if a price is excessive or not in these circumstances drug manufacturers must submit a proposed price to the appropriate regulatory agency
=== braziledit ===
in brazil the prices are regulated through a legislation under the name of medicamento genrico (generic drugs) since 1999
=== united statesedit ===
in the united states drug costs are unregulated but instead are the result of negotiations between drug companies and insurance companies
== blockbuster drugedit ==
a blockbuster drug is a drug generating more than $1 billion of revenue for the pharmaceutical company that sells it each year cimetidine was the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales thus making it the first blockbuster drug
in the pharmaceutical industry a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for most commonly a highly prevalent chronic (rather than acute) condition patients often take the medicines for long periods.

== historyedit ==
=== prescription drug historyedit ===
antibiotics first arrived on the medical scene in 1932 thanks to gerhard domagk and coined the wonder drugs the introduction of the sulfa drugs led to a decline in the u.s mortality rate from pneumonia to drop from 0.2% each year to 0.05% by 1939 antibiotics inhibit the growth or the metabolic activities of bacteria and other microorganisms by a chemical substance of microbial origin penicillin introduced a few years later provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects streptomycin found in 1942 proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics a second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s aureomycin and chloramphenicol aureomycin was the best known of the second generation
lithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect it was cheap and easily produced as lithium fell out of favor in france valpromide came into play this antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant the term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the west through the 1980s in japan during this time the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished
premarin (conjugated estrogens introduced in 1942) and prempro (a combination estrogen-progestin pill introduced in 1995) dominated the hormone replacement therapy (hrt) during the 1990s hrt is not a life-saving drug nor does it cure any disease hrt has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases in the 1960s and early 1970s more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients between 1991 to 1999 premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in america
the first oral contraceptive enovid was approved by fda in 1960 oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm as early as 1960 oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer in the 1980s and 1990s an increasing number of options arose including most recently a new delivery system for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch in 1982 a new version of the pill was introduced known as the biphasic pill by 1985 a new triphasic pill was approved physicians began to think of the pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women
stimulants such as ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly it wasn't until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that ritalin came onto the market medical use of methlyphanidate is predominately for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) consumption of methylphenidate in the u.s out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999 significant growth in consumption was also evident in canada new zealand australia and norway currently 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in america
the first minor tranquilizer was meprobamate only fourteen months after it was made available meprobamate had become the country's largest-selling prescription drug by 1957 meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history the popularity of meprobamate paved the way for librium and valium two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines these were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants the first benzodiazepine was librium three months after it was approved librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation three years later valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine in 1970 sales began to decline for valium and librium but sales of new and improved tranquilizers such as xanax introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder soared
mevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the american market the 1991 launch of pravachol (pravastatin) the second available in the united states and the release of zocor (simvastatin) made mevacor no longer the only statin on the market in 1998 viagra was released as a treatment for erectile dysfunction
=== ancient pharmacologyedit ===
using plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to prehistoric medicine
the kahun gynaecological papyrus the oldest known medical text of any kind dates to about 1800 bc and represents the first documented use of any kind of drug it and other medical papyri describe ancient egyptian medical practices such as using honey to treat infections and the legs of bee-eaters to treat neck pains
ancient babylonian medicine demonstrate the use of prescriptions in the first half of the 2nd millennium bc medicinal creams and pills were employed as treatments
on the indian subcontinent the atharvaveda a sacred text of hinduism whose core dates from the 2nd millennium bc although the hymns recorded in it are believed to be older is the first indic text dealing with medicine it describes plant-based drugs to counter diseases the earliest foundations of ayurveda were built on a synthesis of selected ancient herbal practices together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations new nosologies and new therapies dating from about 400 bc onwards the student of yurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines distillation operative skills cooking horticulture metallurgy sugar manufacture pharmacy analysis and separation of minerals compounding of metals and preparation of alkalis
the hippocratic oath for physicians attributed to 5th century bc greece refers to the existence of deadly drugs and ancient greek physicians imported drugs from egypt and elsewhere
=== medieval pharmacologyedit ===
al-kindi's 9th century ad book de gradibus and ibn sina (avicenna)'s the canon of medicine cover a range of drugs known to medicine in the medieval islamic world
medieval medicine saw advances in surgery but few truly effective drugs existed beyond opium (found in such extremely popular drugs as the great rest at the time) and quinine folklore cures and potentially poisonous metal-based compounds were popular treatments theodoric borgognoni (12051296) one of the most significant surgeons of the medieval period responsible for introducing and promoting important surgical advances including basic antiseptic practice and the use of anaesthetics garcia de orta described some herbal treatments that were used
=== modern pharmacologyedit ===
for most of the 19th century drugs were not highly effective leading oliver wendell holmes sr to famously comment in 1842 that if all medicines in the world were thrown into the sea it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes
during the first world war alexis carrel and henry dakin developed the carrel-dakin method of treating wounds with an irrigation dakin's solution a germicide which helped prevent gangrene
in the inter-war period the first anti-bacterial agents such as the sulpha antibiotics were developed the second world war saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of penicillin antibiotics made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of british scientists with the american pharmaceutical industry
medicines commonly used by the late 1920s included aspirin codeine and morphine for pain digitalis nitroglycerin and quinine for heart disorders and insulin for diabetes other drugs included antitoxins a few biological vaccines and a few synthetic drugs in the 1930s antibiotics emerged first sulfa drugs then penicillin and other antibiotics drugs increasingly became the center of medical practice in the 1950s other drugs emerged including corticosteroids for inflammation rauwolfia alkaloids as tranqulizers and antihypertensives antihistamines for nasal allergies xanthines for asthma and typical antipsychotics for psychosis as of 2007 thousands of approved drugs have been developed increasingly biotechnology is used to discover biopharmaceuticals recently multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on the development of novel antibiotics and antibacterials and on the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy
in the 1950s new psychiatric drugs notably the antipsychotic chlorpromazine were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use although often accepted as an advance in some ways there was some opposition due to serious adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control
governments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales in the u.s. the elixir sulfanilamide disaster led to the establishment of the food and drug administration and the 1938 federal food drug and cosmetic act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the fda the 1951 humphrey-durham amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription in 1962 a subsequent amendment required new drugs to be tested for efficacy and safety in clinical trials
until the 1970s drug prices were not a major concern for doctors and patients as more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses however costs became burdensome and by the 1970s nearly every u.s state required or encouraged the substitution of generic drugs for higher-priced brand names this also led to the 2006 u.s law medicare part d which offers medicare coverage for drugs
as of 2008 the united states is the leader in medical research including pharmaceutical development u.s drug prices are among the highest in the world and drug innovation is correspondingly high in 2000 u.s based firms developed 29 of the 75 top-selling drugs firms from the second-largest market japan developed eight and the united kingdom contributed 10 france which imposes price controls developed three throughout the 1990s outcomes were similar
== controversiesedit ==
controversies concerning pharmaceutical drugs include patient access to drugs under development and not yet approved pricing and environmental issues
=== access to unapproved drugsedit ===
governments worldwide have created provisions for granting access to drugs prior to approval for patients who have exhausted all alternative treatment options and do not match clinical trial entry criteria often grouped under the labels of compassionate use expanded access or named patient supply these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria data collection promotion and control of drug distribution
within the united states pre-approval demand is generally met through treatment ind (investigational new drug) applications (inds) or single-patient inds these mechanisms which fall under the label of expanded access programs provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the us outside the us named patient programs provide controlled pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific or named patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient's home country through these programs patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine unmet medical need before those drugs have been licensed in the patient's home country
patients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access in the united states act up formed in the 1980s and eventually formed its treatment action group in part to pressure the us government to put more resources into discovering treatments for aids and then to speed release of drugs that were under development
the abigail alliance was established in november 2001 by frank burroughs in memory of his daughter abigail the alliance seeks broader availability of investigational drugs on behalf of terminally ill patients
in 2013 biomarin pharmaceutical was at the center of a high profile debate regarding expanded access of cancer patients to experimental drugs
=== access to medicines and drug pricingedit ===
essential medicines as defined by the world health organization (who) are those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population they should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms at a price the community can afford. recent studies have found that most of the medicines on the who essential medicines list outside of the field of hiv drugs are not patented in the developing world and that lack of widespread access to these medicines arise from issues fundamental to economic development - lack of infrastructure and poverty mdecins sans frontires also runs a campaign for access to essential medicines campaign which includes advocacy for greater resources to be devoted to currently untreatable diseases that primarily occur in the developing world the access to medicine index tracks how well pharmaceutical companies make their products available in the developing world
world trade organization negotiations in the 1990s including the trips agreement and the doha declaration have centered on issues at the intersection of international trade in pharmaceuticals and intellectual property rights with developed world nations seeking strong intellectual property rights to protect investments made to develop new drugs and developing world nations seeking to promote their generic pharmaceuticals industries and their ability to make medicine available to their people via compulsory licenses
some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for drugs that they enable their proprietors to charge which poor people in the developed world and developing world cannot afford critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development one study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development other critics claim that patent settlements would be costly for consumers the health care system and state and federal governments because it would result in delaying access to lower cost generic medicines
novartis fought a protracted battle with the government of india over the patenting of its drug gleevec in india which ended up in india's supreme court in a case known as novartis v union of india & others the supreme court ruled narrowly against novartis but opponents of patenting drugs claimed it as a major victory
=== environmental issuesedit ===
the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products is controversial ppcps are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons and the products used by agribusiness to boost growth or health of livestock ppcps comprise a diverse collection of thousands of chemical substances including prescription and over-the-counter therapeutic drugs veterinary drugs fragrances and cosmetics ppcps have been detected in water bodies throughout the world and ones that persist in the environment are called environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants the effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known but to date there is no scientific evidence that they have an impact on human health
