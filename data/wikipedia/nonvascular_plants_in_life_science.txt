physical properties of materials and systems are often described as intensive and extensive properties this classification relates to the dependency of the properties upon the size or extent of the system or object in question
the distinction is based on the concept that smaller non-interacting identical subdivisions of the system may be identified so that the property of interest does or does not change when the system is divided or combined
an intensive property is a bulk property meaning that it is a physical property of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system examples of intensive properties include temperature refractive index density and hardness of an object when a diamond is cut the pieces maintain their intrinsic hardness (until their size reaches a few atoms thick)
by contrast an extensive property is additive for independent non-interacting subsystems the property is proportional to the amount of material in the system for example both the mass and the volume of a diamond are directly proportional to the amount that is left after cutting it from the raw mineral mass and volume are extensive properties but hardness is intensive
the ratio of two extensive properties of the same object or system is scale-invariant and is therefore an intensive property for example the ratio of the extensive properties mass and volume the density is an intensive property
this terminology of intensive and extensive properties was introduced by richard c tolman in 1917
== intensive propertiesedit ==
an intensive property is a physical quantity whose value does not depend on the amount of the substance for which it is measured for example the temperature of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it if the system is divided the temperature of each subsystem is identical the same applies to the density of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half the mass and the volume change in the identical ratio and the density remains unchanged additionally the boiling point of a substance is another example of an intensive property for example the boiling point for water is 100 c at a pressure of one atmosphere which remains true regardless of quantity
according to the state postulate a sufficiently simple thermodynamic system requires only two independent intensive variables to fully specify the system's entire state other intensive properties are derived from the two known values
some intensive properties such as viscosity are empirical macroscopic quantities and are not relevant to extremely small systems
=== combined intensive propertiesedit ===
there are four properties in any thermodynamic system two are intensive and two are extensive
if the set of parameters  are intensive properties and another set  are extensive properties then the function is an intensive property if for all 
it follows for example that the ratio of two extensive properties is an intensive property - density (intensive) is equal to mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive)

examples of intensive properties include:
== extensive propertiesedit ==
the iupac green book defines an extensive property as a physical quantity that is the sum of the properties of separate non-interacting subsystems that compose the entire system the value of such an additive property is proportional to the size of the system it describes or to the quantity of matter in the system taking on the example of melting ice the amount of heat required to melt ice is an extensive property the amount of heat required to melt one ice cube would be much less than the amount of heat required to melt an iceberg so it is dependent on the quantity
extensive properties are the counterparts of intensive properties which are intrinsic to a particular subsystem dividing one type of extensive property by a different type of extensive property generally gives an intensive valuefor example: mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive) gives density (intensive)
=== combined extensive propertiesedit ===
if a set of parameters are intensive properties and another set are extensive properties then the function is an extensive property if for all 
thus extensive properties are homogeneous functions (of degree 1) with respect to  it follows from euler's homogeneous function theorem that
where the partial derivative is taken with all parameters constant except  the converse is also true: any function that obeys the above relationship is extensive

== related extensive and intensive propertiesedit ==
although not true for all physical properties some properties have corresponding extensive and intensive analogs many of which are thermodynamic properties examples of such extensive thermodynamic properties that are dependent on the size of the thermodynamic system in question include volume internal energy enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy helmholtz free energy and heat capacity (in the sense of thermal mass) the symbols of these extensive thermodynamic properties shown here are capital letters
for homogeneous substances these extensive thermodynamic properties each have corresponding intensive thermodynamic properties which are expressed on a per mass or volume basis the name is usually prefixed with the adjective specific to indicate that they are bulk properties valid at any location (smaller subdivision) in a thermodynamic system they may be dependent on other conditions at any point such as temperature pressure and material composition but are not considered dependent on the size of a thermodynamic system or on the amount of material in the system
specific volume is volume per massthe reciprocal of density which equals mass per volume
* l = liter j = joule
** specific properties expressed on a per mass basis
*** specific volume is the reciprocal of density
if a molecular weight can be assigned for the substance or the amount of substance (in moles) can be determined then each of these thermodynamic properties may be expressed on a molar basis and their name may be qualified with the adjective molar yielding terms such as molar volume molar internal energy molar enthalpy molar entropy standards for the symbols of molar quantities do not exist a well known molar volume is that of an ideal gas at standard conditions for temperature and pressure with the value 22.41liters/mol molar gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as chemical potential symbolized by  particularly when discussing a partial molar gibbs free energy i for a component i in a mixture
== generality of classificationedit ==
the general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science redlich noted that physical properties and especially thermodynamic properties are most conveniently defined as either intensive or extensive however these two categories are not all-inclusive and some well-defined physical properties conform to neither definition redlich also provides examples of mathematical functions that alter the strict additivity relationship for extensive system such as the square or square root of volume which occur in some contexts albeit rarely used
other systems for which standard definitions do not provide a simple answer are systems in which the subsystems interact when combined redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged for example if two identical galvanic cells are connected in parallel the voltage of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell while the electric charge transferred (or the electric current) is extensive however if the same cells are connected in series the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive the iupac definitions do not consider such cases
