an invention is a unique or novel device method composition or process the invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process it may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result an invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field an inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure
some inventions can be patented a patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention the rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive
another meaning of invention is cultural invention which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others the institute for social inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge experience or capability
== the process of inventionedit ==
=== practical means of inventionedit ===
the idea for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer by writing or drawing by trial and error by making models by experimenting by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers designers architects and scientists co-inventors are frequently named on patents
in addition many inventors keep records of their working process - notebooks photos etc. including leonardo da vinci galileo galilei evangelista torricelli thomas jefferson and albert einstein
in the process of developing an invention the initial idea may change the invention may become simpler more practical it may expand or it may even morph into something totally different working on one invention can lead to others too
history shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur for example the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality
=== conceptual meansedit ===
invention is often a creative process an open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known seeing a new possibility connection or relationship can spark an invention inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention
==== playedit ====
play may lead to invention childhood curiosity experimentation and imagination can develop one's play instinctan inner need according to carl jung inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them and to explore and this internal drive brings about novel creations
sometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns for example both j k rowling (the creator of harry potter) and frank hornby (the inventor of meccano) first had their ideas while on train journeys
==== re-envisionedit ====
to invent is to see anew inventors often envision a new idea seeing it in their mind's eye new ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor's focus is on something else or while relaxing or sleeping a novel idea may come in a flasha eureka moment for example after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity the solution came to einstein suddenly in a dream like a giant die making an indelible impress a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision inventions can also be accidental such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene (teflon)
==== insightedit ====
insight can also be a vital element of invention such inventive insight may begin with questions doubt or a hunch it may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration for example the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-an invention that won the nobel prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting display screens wallpaper and much more (see conductive polymer and organic light-emitting diode or oled)
==== explorationedit ====
invention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome there are failures as well as successes inspiration can start the process but no matter how complete the initial idea inventions typically must be developed
==== improvementedit ====
inventors may for example try to improve something by making it more effective healthier faster more efficient easier to use serve more purposes longer lasting cheaper more ecologically friendly or aesthetically different lighter weight more ergonomic structurally different with new light or color properties etc
=== implementing inventionsedit ===
in economic theory inventions are one of the chief examples of positive externalities a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity one of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalizedunless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions the patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process
=== invention vs innovationedit ===
in the social sciences an innovation is something that is new better and has been adopted the theory for adoption of an innovation called diffusion of innovations considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption this theory was first put forth by everett rogers gabriel tarde also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his laws of imitation
=== purposes of inventionedit ===
an invention can serve many purposes these purposes might differ significantly and may change over time an invention or a further-developed version of it may serve purposes never envisioned by its original inventor(s) or by others living at the time of its original invention as an example consider all the kinds of plastic developed their many uses and the significant growth this material invention is still undergoing
=== invention as defined by patent lawedit ===
the term invention is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide as is often the case for legal concepts its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word additionally the legal concept of invention is quite different in american and european patent law
in europe the first test a patent application must pass is is this an invention? if it is subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive the implicationcounter intuitivelyis that a legal invention is not inherently novel whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by article 52 of the european patent convention that excludes e.g. discoveries as such and software as such the epo boards of appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention following an age-old italians and german tradition british courts don't agree with this interpretation following a 1959 australian decision ("nrdc") they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule a british court once stated that the technical character test implies a ...restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.
in the united states all patent applications are considered inventions the statute explicitly says that the american invention concept includes discoveries (35 usc 100(a)) contrary to the european invention concept the european invention concept corresponds to the american patentable subject matter concept the first test a patent application is submitted to while the statute (35 usc 101) virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable various attempts were made to substantiate the abstract idea test which suffers from abstractness itself but eventually none of them was successful the last attempt so far was the machine or transformation test but the u.s supreme court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best
=== invention in the artsedit ===
invention has a long and important history in the arts inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process while some inventions in the arts are patentable others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them (see patent)
some inventions in art include the
collage and construction invented by picasso
readymade invented by marcel duchamp
mobile invented by alexander calder
combine invented by robert rauschenberg
shaped painting invented by frank stella
motion picture the invention of which is attributed to eadweard muybridge
likewise jackson pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping pouring splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor
inventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses i.e. alexander calder's mobile which is now commonly used over babies cribs funds generated from patents on inventions in art design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work frdric auguste bartholdi's 1879 design patent on the statue of liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas including those sold as souvenirs
==== list of artistic inventorsedit ====
other artists designers and architects who are or were inventors include
some of their inventions have been patented others might have fulfilled the requirements of a patent like the cubist image
