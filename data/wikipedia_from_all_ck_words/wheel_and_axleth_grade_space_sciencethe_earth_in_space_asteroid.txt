a biological system is a complex network of biologically relevant entities as biological organization spans several scales examples of biological systems are populations of organisms or on the organ- and tissue scale in mammals and other animals the circulatory system the respiratory system the nervous system etc
on the micro to the nanoscopic scale examples of biological systems are cells organelles macromolecular complexes and regulatory pathways
a biological system is not to be confused with a living system which is commonly referred to as life for further information see e.g definition of life or synthetic biology
== organ and tissue systems ==
these specific systems are widely studied in human anatomy human systems are also present in many other animals
circulatory system pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart blood and blood vessels
integumentary system skin hair fat and nails
skeletal system structural support and protection with bones cartilage ligaments and tendons
reproductive system the sex organs such as ovaries fallopian tubes uterus vagina mammary glands testes vas deferens seminal vesicles and prostate
digestive system digestion and processing food with salivary glands esophagus stomach liver gallbladder pancreas intestines rectum and anus
urinary system kidneys ureters bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance electrolyte balance and excretion of urine
respiratory system the organs used for breathing the pharynx larynx bronchi lungs and diaphragm
endocrine system communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus pituitary gland pineal body or pineal gland thyroid parathyroid and adrenals i.e. adrenal glands
lymphatic system structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream includes the lymph and the nodes and vessels the lymphatic system includes functions including immune responses and development of antibodies
muscular system allows for manipulation of the environment provides locomotion maintains posture and produces heat includes skeletal muscles smooth muscles and cardiac muscle
nervous system collecting transferring and processing information with brain spinal cord and peripheral nervous system
immune system protects the organism from foreign bodies
