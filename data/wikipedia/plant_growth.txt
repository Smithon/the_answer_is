plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants this is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy which is the study of the internal structure of plants especially at the microscopic level plant morphology is useful in the visual identification of plants
== scopeedit ==
plant morphology "represents a study of the development form and structure of plants and by implication an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin." there are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology and each overlaps with another field of the biological sciences
first of all morphology is comparative meaning that the morphologist examines structures in many different plants of the same or different species then draws comparisons and formulates ideas about similarities when structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common inherited genetic pathways those structures are termed homologous for example the leaves of pine oak and cabbage all look very different but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts the homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make the plant morphologist goes further and discovers that the spines of cactus also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well this aspect of plant morphology overlaps with the study of plant evolution and paleobotany
secondly plant morphology observes both the vegetative (somatic) structures of plants as well as the reproductive structures the vegetative structures of vascular plants includes the study of the shoot system composed of stems and leaves as well as the root system the reproductive structures are more varied and are usually specific to a particular group of plants such as flowers and seeds fern sori and moss capsules the detailed study of reproductive structures in plants led to the discovery of the alternation of generations found in all plants and most algae this area of plant morphology overlaps with the study of biodiversity and plant systematics
thirdly plant morphology studies plant structure at a range of scales at the smallest scales are ultrastructure the general structural features of cells visible only with the aid of an electron microscope and cytology the study of cells using optical microscopy at this scale plant morphology overlaps with plant anatomy as a field of study at the largest scale is the study of plant growth habit the overall architecture of a plant the pattern of branching in a tree will vary from species to species as will the appearance of a plant as a tree herb or grass
fourthly plant morphology examines the pattern of development the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows while animals produce all the body parts they will ever have from early in their life plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life a living plant always has embryonic tissues the way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plant's life when they begin to develop as well as by the environment to which the structures are exposed a morphologist studies this process the causes and its result this area of plant morphology overlaps with plant physiology and ecology
== a comparative scienceedit ==
a plant morphologist makes comparisons between structures in many different plants of the same or different species making such comparisons between similar structures in different plants tackles the question of why the structures are similar it is quite likely that similar underlying causes of genetics physiology or response to the environment have led to this similarity in appearance the result of scientific investigation into these causes can lead to one of two insights into the underlying biology:
homology - the structure is similar between the two species because of shared ancestry and common genetics
convergence - the structure is similar between the two species because of independent adaptation to common environmental pressures
understanding which characteristics and structures belong to each type is an important part of understanding plant evolution the evolutionary biologist relies on the plant morphologist to interpret structures and in turn provides phylogenies of plant relationships that may lead to new morphological insights
=== homologyedit ===
when structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common inherited genetic pathways those structures are termed homologous for example the leaves of pine oak and cabbage all look very different but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts the homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make the plant morphologist goes further and discovers that the spines of cactus also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well
=== convergenceedit ===
when structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common adaptive responses to environmental pressure those structures are termed convergent for example the fronds of bryopsis plumosa and stems of asparagus setaceus both have the same feathery branching appearance even though one is an alga and one is a flowering plant the similarity in overall structure occurs independently as a result of convergence the growth form of many cacti and species of euphorbia is very similar even though they belong to widely distant families the similarity results from common solutions to the problem of surviving in a hot dry environment
== vegetative and reproductive characteristicsedit ==
plant morphology treats both the vegetative structures of plants as well as the reproductive structures
the vegetative (somatic) structures of vascular plants include two major organ systems: (1) a shoot system composed of stems and leaves and (2) a root system these two systems are common to nearly all vascular plants and provide a unifying theme for the study of plant morphology
by contrast the reproductive structures are varied and are usually specific to a particular group of plants structures such as flowers and fruits are only found in the angiosperms; sori are only found in ferns; and seed cones are only found in conifers and other gymnosperms reproductive characters are therefore regarded as more useful for the classification of plants than vegetative characters
=== use in identificationedit ===
plant biologists use morphological characters of plants which can be compared measured counted and described to assess the differences or similarities in plant taxa and use these characters for plant identification classification and descriptions
when characters are used in descriptions or for identification they are called diagnostic or key characters which can be either qualitative and quantitative
quantitative characters are morphological features that can be counted or measured for example a plant species has flower petals 1012 mm wide
qualitative characters are morphological features such as leaf shape flower color or pubescence
both kinds of characters can be very useful for the identification of plants
=== alternation of generationsedit ===
the detailed study of reproductive structures in plants led to the discovery of the alternation of generations found in all plants and most algae by the german botanist wilhelm hofmeister this discovery is one of the most important made in all of plant morphology since it provides a common basis for understanding the life cycle of all plants
=== pigmentation in plantsedit ===
the primary function of pigments in plants is photosynthesis which uses the green pigment chlorophyll along with several red and yellow pigments that help to capture as much light energy as possible pigments are also an important factor in attracting insects to flowers to encourage pollination
plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecule including porphyrins carotenoids anthocyanins and betalains all biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light while reflecting others the light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power chemical reactions while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the color the pigment will appear to the eye
== developmentedit ==
plant development is the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows it is a subject studies in plant anatomy and plant physiology as well as plant morphology
the process of development in plants is fundamentally different from that seen in vertebrate animals when an animal embryo begins to develop it will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life when the animal is born (or hatches from its egg) it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature by contrast plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from meristems located at the tips of organs or between mature tissues thus a living plant always has embryonic tissues
the properties of organization seen in a plant are emergent properties which are more than the sum of the individual parts "the assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts." in other words knowing everything about the molecules in a plant are not enough to predict characteristics of the cells; and knowing all the properties of the cells will not predict all the properties of a plant's structure
=== growthedit ===
a vascular plant begins from a single celled zygote formed by fertilisation of an egg cell by a sperm cell from that point it begins to divide to form a plant embryo through the process of embryogenesis as this happens the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root while the other end forms the tip of the shoot in seed plants the embryo will develop one or more "seed leaves" (cotyledons) by the end of embryogenesis the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life
once the embryo germinates from its seed or parent plant it begins to produce additional organs (leaves stems and roots) through the process of organogenesis new roots grow from root meristems located at the tip of the root and new stems and leaves grow from shoot meristems located at the tip of the shoot branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem and which have not yet undergone cellular differentiation to form a specialized tissue begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed primary growth and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot secondary growth results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a cambium
in addition to growth by cell division a plant may grow through cell elongation this occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer not all plant cells will grow to the same length when cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result this directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus such as light (phototropism) gravity (gravitropism) water (hydrotropism) and physical contact (thigmotropism)
plant growth and development are mediated by specific hormones and plant growth regulators (pgrs) (ross et al 1983) endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age cold hardiness dormancy and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod drought temperature and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of pgrs e.g. externally applied and of rhizospheric origin
=== morphological variationedit ===
plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure while all organisms vary from individual to individual plants exhibit an additional type of variation within a single individual parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts this variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation there are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects environmental effects and juvenility
==== positional effectsedit ====
although plants produce numerous copies of the same organ during their lives not all copies of a particular organ will be identical there is variation among the parts of a mature plant resulting from the relative position where the organ is produced for example along a new branch the leaves may vary in a consistent pattern along the branch the form of leaves produced near the base of the branch will differ from leaves produced at the tip of the plant and this difference is consistent from branch to branch on a given plant and in a given species this difference persists after the leaves at both ends of the branch have matured and is not the result of some leaves being younger than others
==== environmental effectsedit ====
the way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plants life when they begin to develop as well as by the environment to which the structures are exposed this can be seen in aquatic plants and emergent plants
===== temperatureedit =====
temperature has a multiplicity of effects on plants depending on a variety of factors including the size and condition of the plant and the temperature and duration of exposure the smaller and more succulent the plant the greater the susceptibility to damage or death from temperatures that are too high or too low temperature affects the rate of biochemical and physiological processes rates generally (within limits) increasing with temperature however the vant hoff relationship for monomolecular reactions (which states that the velocity of a reaction is doubled or trebled by a temperature increase of 10c) does not strictly hold for biological processes especially at low and high temperatures
when water freezes in plants the consequences for the plant depend very much on whether the freezing occurs intracellularly (within cells) or outside cells in intercellular (extracellular) spaces intracellular freezing usually kills the cell regardless of the hardiness of the plant and its tissues intracellular freezing seldom occurs in nature but moderate rates of decrease in temperature e.g. 1c to 6c/hour cause intercellular ice to form and this "extraorgan ice" may or may not be lethal depending on the hardiness of the tissue
at freezing temperatures water in the intercellular spaces of plant tissues freezes first though the water may remain unfrozen until temperatures fall below 7c after the initial formation of ice intercellularly the cells shrink as water is lost to the segregated ice the cells undergo freeze-drying the dehydration being the basic cause of freezing injury
the rate of cooling has been shown to influence the frost resistance of tissues but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30c to -40c these freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed floral primordia responded similarly extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50c or lower the hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds by the evolution of faster translocation of water and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration in boreal species of picea and pinus the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants given similar states of dormancy
==== juvenilityedit ====
the organs and tissues produced by a young plant such as a seedling are often different from those that are produced by the same plant when it is older this phenomenon is known as juvenility for example young trees will produce longer leaner branches that grow upwards more than the branches they will produce as a fully grown tree in addition leaves produced during early growth tend to be larger thinner and more irregular than leaves on the adult plant specimens of juvenile plants may look so completely different from adult plants of the same species that egg-laying insects do not recognize the plant as food for their young differences are seen in rootability and flowering and can be seen in the same mature tree juvenile cuttings taken from the base of a tree will form roots much more readily than cuttings originating from the mid to upper crown flowering close to the base of a tree is absent or less profuse than flowering in the higher branches especially when a young tree first reaches flowering age
== some recent developmentsedit ==
rolf sattler has revised fundamental concepts of comparative morphology such as the concept of homology he emphasized that homology should also include partial homology and quantitative homology this leads to a continuum morphology that demonstrates a continuum between the morphological categories of root shoot stem (caulome) leaf (phyllome) and hair (trichome) how intermediates between the categories are best described has been discussed by bruce k kirchoff et al
honoring agnes arber author of the partial-shoot theory of the leaf rutishauser and isler called the continuum approach fuzzy arberian morphology (fam) fuzzy refers to fuzzy logic arberian to agnes arber rutishauser and isler emphasized that this approach is not only supported by many morphological data but also by evidence from molecular genetics more recent evidence from molecular genetics provides further support for continuum morphology james (2009) concluded that "it is now widely accepted that radiality [characteristic of most shoots] and dorsiventrality [characteristic of leaves] are but extremes of a continuous spectrum in fact it is simply the timing of the knox gene expression!." eckardt and baum (2010) concluded that "it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties
process morphology (dynamic morphology) describes and analyzes the dynamic continuum of plant form according to this approach structures do not have process(es) they are process(es) thus the structure/process dichotomy is overcome by "an enlargement of our concept of 'structure' so as to include and recognize that in the living organism it is not merely a question of spatial structure with an 'activity' as something over or against it but that the concrete organism is a spatio-temporal structure and that this spatio-temporal structure is the activity itself."
for jeune barab and lacroix classical morphology (that is mainstream morphology based on a qualitative homology concept implying mutually exclusive categories) and continuum morphology are sub-classes of the more encompassing process morphology (dynamic morphology)
