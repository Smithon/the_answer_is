photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy normally from the sun into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name photosynthesis from the greek  phs "light" and  synthesis "putting together" in most cases oxygen is also released as a waste product most plants most algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs photosynthesis maintains atmospheric oxygen levels and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on earth
although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments in plants these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts which are most abundant in leaf cells while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane in these light-dependent reactions some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances such as water producing oxygen gas furthermore two further compounds are generated: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) and adenosine triphosphate (atp) the "energy currency" of cells
in plants algae and cyanobacteria sugars are produced by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the calvin cycle but some bacteria use different mechanisms such as the reverse krebs cycle in the calvin cycle atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds such as ribulose bisphosphate (rubp) using the atp and nadph produced by the light-dependent reactions the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates such as glucose
the first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons rather than water cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe which rendered the evolution of complex life possible today the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts which is about three times the current power consumption of human civilization photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100115 thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year
== overview ==
photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light however not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds rather than carbon dioxide as a source of carbon in plants algae and cyanobacteria photosynthesis releases oxygen this is called oxygenic photosynthesis although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants algae and cyanobacteria the overall process is quite similar in these organisms however there are some types of bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis these consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen
carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process and the electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate this addition of the electrons is a reduction reaction in general outline and in effect photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration in which glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water and to release exothermic chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism however the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments
the general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by cornelius van niel is therefore:
co2 + 2h2a + photons [ch2o] + 2a + h2o
carbon dioxide + electron donor + light energy carbohydrate + oxidized electron donor + water
since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis the equation for this process is:
n co2 + 2n h2o + photons (ch2o)n + n o2 + n h2o
carbon dioxide + water + light energy carbohydrate + oxygen + water
this equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant (in the light-dependent reaction) and a product (in the light-independent reaction) but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation:
n co2 + n h2o + photons (ch2o)n + n o2
carbon dioxide + water + light energy carbohydrate + oxygen
other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate: the equation for this reaction is:
co2 + (aso33) + photons (aso43) + co
carbon dioxide + arsenite + light energy arsenate + carbon monoxide (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)
photosynthesis occurs in two stages in the first stage light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules atp and nadph during the second stage the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide
most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so although at least three use shortwave infrared or more specifically far-red radiation
archaeobacteria use a simpler method using a pigment similar to the pigments used for vision the archaearhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight acting as a proton pump this produces a proton gradient more directly which is then converted to chemical energy the process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen it seems to have evolved separately
== photosynthetic membranes and organelles ==
in photosynthetic bacteria the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes in its simplest form this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself however the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes these structures can fill most of the interior of a cell giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb
in plants and algae photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts a typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts the chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane this membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane a phospholipid outer membrane and an intermembrane space between them within the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma the stroma contains stacks (grana) of thylakoids which are the site of photosynthesis the thylakoids are flattened disks bounded by a membrane with a lumen or thylakoid space within it the site of photosynthesis is the thylakoid membrane which contains integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes including the pigments that absorb light energy which form the photosystems
plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll which is the reason that most plants have a green color besides chlorophyll plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls algae also use chlorophyll but various other pigments are present such as phycocyanin carotenes and xanthophylls in green algae phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors
these pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins in such proteins all the pigments are ordered to work well together such a protein is also called a light-harvesting complex
although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts most of the energy in higher plants is captured in the leaves - certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity such as many euphorbia and cactus species have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems the cells in the interior tissues of a leaf called the mesophyll can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf the surface of the leaf is uniformly coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to reduce heating the transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place
== light-dependent reactions ==
in the light-dependent reactions one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron this electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin which passes the electron to a quinone molecule allowing the start of a flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of nadp to nadph in addition this creates a proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane; its dissipation is used by atp synthase for the concomitant synthesis of atp the chlorophyll molecule regains the lost electron from a water molecule through a process called photolysis which releases a dioxygen (o2) molecule the overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:
2 h2o + 2 nadp+ + 3 adp + 3 pi + light 2 nadph + 2 h+ + 3 atp + o2
not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis the photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present for example in green plants the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with peaks for violet-blue and red light in red algae the action spectrum overlaps with the absorption spectrum of phycobilins for red blue-green light which allows these algae to grow in deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths used by green plants the non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g. green plants red algae purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms
=== z scheme ===
in plants light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and use light energy to synthesize atp and nadph the light-dependent reaction has two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic in the non-cyclic reaction the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem ii by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram at right) when a chlorophyll molecule at the core of the photosystem ii reaction center obtains sufficient excitation energy from the adjacent antenna pigments an electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule pheophytin through a process called photoinduced charge separation these electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain the so-called z-scheme shown in the diagram that initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic potential across the membrane an atp synthase enzyme uses the chemiosmotic potential to make atp during photophosphorylation whereas nadph is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the z-scheme the electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in photosystem i the electron is excited due to the light absorbed by the photosystem a second electron carrier accepts the electron which again is passed down lowering energies of electron acceptors the energy created by the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen the electron is used to reduce the co-enzyme nadp which has functions in the light-independent reaction the cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in the form that it generates only atp and no reduced nadp (nadph) is created the cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem i once the electron is displaced from the photosystem the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem i from where it was emitted hence the name cyclic reaction
=== water photolysis ===
the nadph is the main reducing agent in chloroplasts providing a source of energetic electrons to other reactions its production leaves chlorophyll with a deficit of electrons (oxidized) which must be obtained from some other reducing agent the excited electrons lost from chlorophyll in photosystem i are replaced from the electron transport chain by plastocyanin however since photosystem ii includes the first steps of the z-scheme an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a molecules the source of electrons in green-plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is water two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem ii to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions; the electron yielded in each step is transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that then reduces the photoxidized paired-chlorophyll a species called p680 that serves as the primary (light-driven) electron donor in the photosystem ii reaction center the oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem ii by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and stores the four oxidizing equivalents that are required to drive the water-oxidizing reaction photosystem ii is the only known biological enzyme that carries out this oxidation of water the hydrogen ions contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to atp synthesis oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions but the majority of organisms on earth use oxygen for cellular respiration including photosynthetic organisms
== light-independent reactions ==
=== calvin cycle ===
in the light-independent (or "dark") reactions the enzyme rubisco captures co2 from the atmosphere and in a process called the calvin-benson cycle that requires the newly formed nadph releases three-carbon sugars which are later combined to form sucrose and starch the overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is
3 co2 + 9 atp + 6 nadph + 6 h+ c3h6o3-phosphate + 9 adp + 8 pi + 6 nadp+ + 3 h2o
carbon fixation produces an intermediate product which is then converted to the final carbohydrate products the carbon skeletons produced by photosynthesis are then variously used to form other organic compounds such as the building material cellulose as precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis or as a fuel in cellular respiration the latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the energy from plants gets passed through a food chain
the fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound glycerate 3-phosphate also known as 3-phosphoglycerate glycerate 3-phosphate in the presence of atp and nadph produced during the light-dependent stages is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate this product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (pgal) or more generically as triose phosphate most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue the triose phosphates not thus "recycled" often condense to form hexose phosphates which ultimately yield sucrose starch and cellulose the sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids
=== carbon concentrating mechanisms ===
==== on land ====
in hot and dry conditions plants close their stomata to prevent water loss under these conditions co2 will decrease and oxygen gas produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis will increase causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and decrease in carbon fixation some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the co2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions
c4 plants chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called pep carboxylase creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme rubisco and other calvin cycle enzymes are located and where co2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by rubisco activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids the physical separation of rubisco from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases co2 fixation and thus photosynthetic capacity of the leaf c4 plants can produce more sugar than c3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature many important crop plants are c4 plants including maize sorghum sugarcane and millet plants that do not use pep-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called c3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction catalyzed by rubisco produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the calvin-benson cycle over 90% of plants use c3 carbon fixation compared to 3% that use c4 carbon fixation; however the evolution of c4 in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution
xerophytes such as cacti and most succulents also use pep carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called crassulacean acid metabolism (cam) in contrast to c4 metabolism which physically separates the co2 fixation to pep from the calvin cycle cam temporally separates these two processes cam plants have a different leaf anatomy from c3 plants and fix the co2 at night when their stomata are open cam plants store the co2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate which is then reduced to malate decarboxylation of malate during the day releases co2 inside the leaves thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by rubisco sixteen thousand species of plants use cam
==== in water ====
cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes which increase the concentration of co2 around rubisco to increase the rate of photosynthesis an enzyme carbonic anhydrase located within the carboxysome releases co2 from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (hco3) before the co2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by rubisco which is concentrated within the carboxysomes hco3 ions are made from co2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein they cannot cross the membrane as they are charged and within the cytosol they turn back into co2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase this causes the hco3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate co2 around rubisco
== order and kinetics ==
the overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:
== efficiency ==
plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 36% absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat with a small fraction (1-2%) re-emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths
actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted light intensity temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and can vary from 0.1% to 8% by comparison solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 620% for mass-produced panels and above 40% in laboratory devices
photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf but analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence p700- and p515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g the photosystems quantum efficiency and the co2 assimilation rates with some instruments even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed
a phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly in the photosynthetic cell of an algae bacterium or plant there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex when a photon is absorbed by a chromophore it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism the particle's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously allowing it to instantaneously "choose" the most efficient route where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time because it takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur in quantum walking is only possible over very short distances due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that will come into play these cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic "hop" the distance towards the center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks
== evolution ==
early photosynthetic systems such as those from green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria are thought to have been anoxygenic using various molecules as electron donors green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as an electron donor green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules the use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that the atmosphere was highly reduced at that time
fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old
the main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis such as that in cyanobacteria became important during the paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor which is oxidized to molecular oxygen (o
2) in the photosynthetic reaction center
=== symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts ===
several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae these are most common in corals sponges and sea anemones it is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes in addition a few marine mollusks elysia viridis and elysia chlorotica also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies this allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive
an even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria including a circular chromosome prokaryotic-type ribosomes and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center the endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells therefore chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells like mitochondria chloroplasts still possess their own dna separate from the nuclear dna of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast dna resemble those in cyanobacteria dna in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as photosynthetic reaction centers the corr hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation
=== cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis ===
the biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria the geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in earth's history at least 24502320 million years ago (ma) and it is speculated much earlier because the earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis many scientists believe that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen available evidence from geobiological studies of archean (>2500 ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 ma but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered a clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 ma revealing an already-diverse biota of blue-greens cyanobacteria remained principal primary producers throughout the proterozoic eon (2500543 ma) in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation green algae joined blue-greens as major primary producers on continental shelves near the end of the proterozoic but only with the mesozoic (25165 ma) radiations of dinoflagellates coccolithophorids and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers in oceanic gyres as agents of biological nitrogen fixation and in modified form as the plastids of marine algae
the oriental hornet (vespa orientalis) converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called xanthopterin this is the first evidence of a member of the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis
== discovery ==
although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century
jan van helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew after noticing that the soil mass changed very little he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water the only substance he added to the potted plant his hypothesis was partially accurate much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water however this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis not the soil itself
joseph priestley a chemist and minister discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it the candle would burn out very quickly much before it ran out of wax he further discovered that a mouse could similarly "injure" air he then showed that the air that had been "injured" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant
in 1778 jan ingenhousz court physician to the austrian empress repeated priestley's experiments he discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours
in 1796 jean senebier a swiss pastor botanist and naturalist demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light soon afterward nicolas-thodore de saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of co2 but also to the incorporation of water thus the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined
cornelis van niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis by studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first scientist to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide
robert emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light with the red alone the light reactions were suppressed when blue and red were combined the output was much more substantial thus there were two photosystems one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths the other up to 700 nm the former is known as psii the latter is psi psi contains only chlorophyll a psii contains primarily chlorophyll a with most of the available chlorophyll b among other pigment these include phycobilins which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms the process is most productive when absorption of quanta are equal in both the psii and psi assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the psi and psii system which in turn powers the photochemistry
robert hill thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone) another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms these are linked by plastoquinone which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by hill in 1937 and 1939 he showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light the hill reaction is as follows:
2 h2o + 2 a + (light chloroplasts) 2 ah2 + o2
where a is the electron acceptor therefore in light the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved
samuel ruben and martin kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water
melvin calvin and andrew benson along with james bassham elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants the carbon reduction cycle is known as the calvin cycle which ignores the contribution of bassham and benson many scientists refer to the cycle as the calvin-benson cycle benson-calvin and some even call it the calvin-benson-bassham (or cbb) cycle
nobel prize-winning scientist rudolph a marcus was able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain
otto heinrich warburg and dean burk discovered the i-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the co2 activated by the respiration
louis n.m duysens and jan amesz discovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one light oxidize cytochrome f chlorophyll a (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome stating the two light reactions are in series
=== development of the concept ===
in 1893 charles reid barnes proposed two terms photosyntax and photosynthesis for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid in the presence of chlorophyll under the influence of light over time the term photosynthesis came into common usage as the term of choice later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term
== factors ==
there are three main factors affecting photosynthesis and several corollary factors the three main are:
light irradiance and wavelength
carbon dioxide concentration
temperature
=== light intensity (irradiance) wavelength and temperature ===
the process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life (jones 1992)
spectral responses of various physiological processes differ; therefore instruments for measuring them must be appropriately sensitive combinations of photocells and filters can approximate the responses needed to measure either irradiance in the par or photon irradiance in the par such instruments are often called photosynthetic energy and quantum sensors respectively (jones 1992) radiometers measure radiant flux density and pyranometers or solarimeters measure total shortwave radiation incident upon a surface photosynthesis does not respond linearly to light hence the average irradiance cannot be expected to predict co2 uptake well furthermore the high irradiance within sunflecks may even cause photoinhibitory damage to the chloroplasts for many purposes especially in studies of photosynthesis the average irradiance on a horizontal surface at any depth in the canopy is not the value of interest (jones 1992)
the radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable both spatially and temporally
in the early 20th century frederick blackman and gabrielle matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation
at constant temperature the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance initially increasing as the irradiance increases however at higher irradiance this relationship no longer holds and the rate of carbon assimilation reaches a plateau
at constant irradiance the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased over a limited range this effect is seen only at high irradiance levels at low irradiance increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation
these two experiments illustrate several important points: first from research it is known that in general photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature however these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation these are of course the light-dependent 'photochemical' stage and the light-independent temperature-dependent stage second blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors another limiting factor is the wavelength of light cyanobacteria which reside several meters underwater cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments to combat this problem a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center this unit is called a phycobilisome
=== carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration ===
as carbon dioxide concentrations rise the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors rubisco the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen when the concentration of carbon dioxide is high rubisco will fix carbon dioxide however if the carbon dioxide concentration is low rubisco will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide this process called photorespiration uses energy but does not produce sugars
rubisco oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:
one product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon) phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the calvin-benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle a high oxygenase activity therefore drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the calvin-benson cycle
phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis
salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the calvin-benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate the reactions also produce ammonia (nh3) which is able to diffuse out of the plant leading to a loss of nitrogen
a highly simplified summary is:
2 glycolate + atp 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + adp + nh3
the salvaging pathway for the products of rubisco oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide
