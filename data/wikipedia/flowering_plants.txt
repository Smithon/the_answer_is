the flowering plants (angiosperms) also known as angiospermae or magnoliophyta are the most diverse group of land plants angiosperms are seed-producing plants like the gymnosperms and can be distinguished from the gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers endosperm within the seeds and the production of fruits that contain the seeds etymologically angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure in other words a fruiting plant
the ancestors of flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms around 245202 million years ago and the first flowering plants known to exist are from 160 million years ago they diversified enormously during the lower cretaceous and became widespread around 120 million years ago but replaced conifers as the dominant trees only around 60100 million years ago
== angiosperm derived characteristics ==
angiosperms differ from other seed plants in several ways described in the table these distinguishing characteristics taken together have made the angiosperms the most diverse and numerous land plants and the most commercially important group to humans
== evolution ==
fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated swimming sperm like the green algae from which they evolved an adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats this feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives the charophycean green algae a later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate avascular sexual stage the gametophyte within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte this occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release as in non-seed plants a current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in selaginella the spike-moss the result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case the seed the first seed bearing plants like the ginkgo and conifers (such as pines and firs) did not produce flowers the pollen grains (males) of ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated mobile sperm cells that "swim" down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs
the apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable mystery" by charles darwin however the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of darwin and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as archaefructus along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps several groups of extinct gymnosperms in particular seed ferns have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved some older fossils such as the upper triassic sanmiguelia have been suggested based on current evidence some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms during the late triassic (245202 million years ago) fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the middle triassic (247.2242.0 ma) suggests an older date for their origin a close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes proposed on the basis of morphological evidence has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms
the evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events these occurred at 319 million years ago and 192 million years ago another possible whole genome duplication event at 160 million years ago perhaps created the ancestral line that led to all modern flowering plants that event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant amborella trichopoda and directly addresses darwin's "abominable mystery."
the earliest known macrofossil confidently identified as an angiosperm archaefructus liaoningensis is dated to about 125 million years bp (the cretaceous period) whereas pollen considered to be of angiosperm origin takes the fossil record back to about 130 million years bp however one study has suggested that the early-middle jurassic plant schmeissneria traditionally considered a type of ginkgo may be the earliest known angiosperm or at least a close relative in addition circumstantial chemical evidence has been found for the existence of angiosperms as early as 250 million years ago oleanane a secondary metabolite produced by many flowering plants has been found in permian deposits of that age together with fossils of gigantopterids gigantopterids are a group of extinct seed plants that share many morphological traits with flowering plants although they are not known to have been flowering plants themselves
in 2013 flowers encased in amber were found and dated 100 million years before present the amber had frozen the act of sexual reproduction in the process of taking place microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma the pollen was sticky suggesting it was carried by insects
recent dna analysis based on molecular systematics showed that amborella trichopoda found on the pacific island of new caledonia belongs to a sister group of the other flowering plants and morphological studies suggest that it has features that may have been characteristic of the earliest flowering plants
the orders amborellales nymphaeales and austrobaileyales diverged as separate lineages from the remaining angiosperm clade at a very early stage in flowering plant evolution
the great angiosperm radiation when a great diversity of angiosperms appears in the fossil record occurred in the mid-cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) however a study in 2007 estimated that the division of the five most recent (the genus ceratophyllum the family chloranthaceae the eudicots the magnoliids and the monocots) of the eight main groups occurred around 140 million years ago by the late cretaceous angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes but large canopy-forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later at the beginning of the tertiary the radiation of herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later yet many fossil plants recognizable as belonging to modern families (including beech oak maple and magnolia) had already appeared by the late cretaceous
it is generally assumed that the function of flowers from the start was to involve mobile animals in their reproduction processes that is pollen can be scattered even if the flower is not brightly colored or oddly shaped in a way that attracts animals; however by expending the energy required to create such traits angiosperms can enlist the aid of animals and thus reproduce more efficiently
island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden fully developed appearance of flowering plants island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp for example) such a relationship with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees which it is postulated evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships are descended from wasps
animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds fruit which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it incidentally scattering the seeds it contains (see frugivory) although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life
flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots the most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts often separate from (but in contact with) each other the flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern to be bisexual (in plants this means both male and female parts on the same flower) and to be dominated by the ovary (female part) as flowers evolved some variations developed parts fused together with a much more specific number and design and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least "ovary-inferior"
flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be pollinated in nature many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed some of them tended to grow with human crops perhaps already having symbiotic companion plant relationships with them and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection
a few paleontologists have also proposed that flowering plants or angiosperms might have evolved due to interactions with dinosaurs one of the idea's strongest proponents is robert t bakker he proposes that herbivorous dinosaurs with their eating habits provided a selective pressure on plants for which adaptations either succeeded in deterring or coping with predation by herbivores
== classification ==
there are eight groups of living angiosperms:
amborella a single species of shrub from new caledonia;
nymphaeales about 80 species water lilies and hydatellaceae;
austrobaileyales about 100 species of woody plants from various parts of the world;
chloranthales several dozen species of aromatic plants with toothed leaves;
magnoliids about 9,000 species characterized by trimerous flowers pollen with one pore and usually branching-veined leavesfor example magnolias bay laurel and black pepper;
monocots about 70,000 species characterized by trimerous flowers a single cotyledon pollen with one pore and usually parallel-veined leavesfor example grasses orchids and palms;
ceratophyllum about 6 species of aquatic plants perhaps most familiar as aquarium plants;
eudicots about 175,000 species characterized by 4- or 5-merous flowers pollen with three pores and usually branching-veined leavesfor example sunflowers petunia buttercup apples and oaks
the exact relationship between these eight groups is not yet clear although there is agreement that the first three groups to diverge from the ancestral angiosperm were amborellales nymphaeales and austrobaileyales the term basal angiosperms refers to these three groups among the rest the relationship between the three broadest of these groups (magnoliids monocots and eudicots) remains unclear some analyses make the magnoliids the first to diverge others the monocots ceratophyllum seems to group with the eudicots rather than with the monocots
=== history of classification ===
the botanical term "angiosperm" from the ancient greek  angeon (bottle vessel) and  (seed) was coined in the form angiospermae by paul hermann in 1690 as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom this included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules distinguished from his gymnospermae or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked the term and its antonym were maintained by carl linnaeus with the same sense but with restricted application in the names of the orders of his class didynamia its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827 when robert brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the cycadeae and coniferae and applied to them the name gymnosperms from that time onward as long as these gymnosperms were as was usual reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants the term angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers with varying scope as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants
in 1851 hofmeister discovered the changes occurring in the embryo-sac of flowering plants and determined the correct relationships of these to the cryptogamia this fixed the position of gymnosperms as a class distinct from dicotyledons and the term angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than gymnosperms including the classes of dicotyledons and monocotyledons this is the sense in which the term is used today
in most taxonomies the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group the most popular descriptive name has been angiospermae (angiosperms) with anthophyta ("flowering plants") a second choice these names are not linked to any rank the wettstein system and the engler system use the name angiospermae at the assigned rank of subdivision the reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision magnoliophytina (frohne & u jensen ex reveal phytologia 79: 70 1996) but later split it to magnoliopsida liliopsida and rosopsida the takhtajan system and cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division leading to the name magnoliophyta (from the family name magnoliaceae) the dahlgren system and thorne system (1992) treat this group at the rank of class leading to the name magnoliopsida the apg system of 1998 and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name however a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the subclass magnoliidae
the internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision the cronquist system proposed by arthur cronquist in 1968 and published in its full form in 1981 is still widely used but is no longer believed to accurately reflect phylogeny a consensus about how the flowering plants should be arranged has recently begun to emerge through the work of the angiosperm phylogeny group (apg) which published an influential reclassification of the angiosperms in 1998 updates incorporating more recent research were published as apg ii in 2003 and as apg iii in 2009
traditionally the flowering plants are divided into two groups which in the cronquist system are called magnoliopsida (at the rank of class formed from the family name magnoliaceae) and liliopsida (at the rank of class formed from the family name liliaceae) other descriptive names allowed by article 16 of the icbn include dicotyledones or dicotyledoneae and monocotyledones or monocotyledoneae which have a long history of use in english a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon (plural dicotyledons) and monocotyledon (plural monocotyledons) or abbreviated as dicot (plural dicots) and monocot (plural monocots) these names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two cotyledons or embryonic leaves within each seed the monocots usually have only one but the rule is not absolute either way from a diagnostic point of view the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly handy nor a reliable character
recent studies as by the apg show that the monocots form a monophyletic group (clade) but that the dicots do not (they are paraphyletic) nevertheless the majority of dicot species do form a monophyletic group called the eudicots or tricolpates of the remaining dicot species most belong to a third major clade known as the magnoliids containing about 9,000 species the rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms plus the families ceratophyllaceae and chloranthaceae
=== flowering plant diversity ===
the number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000 this compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse the number of families in apg (1998) was 462 in apg ii (2003) it is not settled; at maximum it is 457 but within this number there are 55 optional segregates so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402 in apg iii (2009) there are 415 families
the diversity of flowering plants is not evenly distributed nearly all species belong to the eudicot (75%) monocot (23%) and magnoliid (2%) clades the remaining 5 clades contain a little over 250 species in total; i.e less than 0.1% of flowering plant diversity divided among 9 families the 42 most-diverse of 443 families of flowering plants by species in their apg circumscriptions are

== vascular anatomy ==
the amount and complexity of tissue-formation in flowering plants exceeds that of gymnosperms the vascular bundles of the stem are arranged such that the xylem and phloem form concentric rings
in the dicotyledons the bundles in the very young stem are arranged in an open ring separating a central pith from an outer cortex in each bundle separating the xylem and phloem is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium) a complete ring is formed and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside the soft phloem becomes crushed but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings one for each season of growth called annual rings
among the monocotyledons the bundles are more numerous in the young stem and are scattered through the ground tissue they contain no cambium and once formed the stem increases in diameter only in exceptional cases
== the flower fruit and seed ==
=== flowers ===
the characteristic feature of angiosperms is the flower flowers show remarkable variation in form and elaboration and provide the most trustworthy external characteristics for establishing relationships among angiosperm species the function of the flower is to ensure fertilization of the ovule and development of fruit containing seeds the floral apparatus may arise terminally on a shoot or from the axil of a leaf (where the petiole attaches to the stem) occasionally as in violets a flower arises singly in the axil of an ordinary foliage-leaf more typically the flower-bearing portion of the plant is sharply distinguished from the foliage-bearing or vegetative portion and forms a more or less elaborate branch-system called an inflorescence
there are two kinds of reproductive cells produced by flowers microspores which will divide to become pollen grains are the "male" cells and are borne in the stamens (or microsporophylls) the "female" cells called megaspores which will divide to become the egg cell (megagametogenesis) are contained in the ovule and enclosed in the carpel (or megasporophyll)
the flower may consist only of these parts as in willow where each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels usually other structures are present and serve to protect the sporophylls and to form an envelope attractive to pollinators the individual members of these surrounding structures are known as sepals and petals (or tepals in flowers such as magnolia where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other) the outer series (calyx of sepals) is usually green and leaf-like and functions to protect the rest of the flower especially the bud the inner series (corolla of petals) is in general white or brightly colored and is more delicate in structure it functions to attract insect or bird pollinators attraction is effected by color scent and nectar which may be secreted in some part of the flower the characteristics that attract pollinators account for the popularity of flowers and flowering plants among humans
while the majority of flowers are perfect or hermaphrodite (having both pollen and ovule producing parts in the same flower structure) flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self-fertilization heteromorphic flowers have short carpels and long stamens or vice versa so animal pollinators cannot easily transfer pollen to the pistil (receptive part of the carpel) homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical (physiological) mechanism called self-incompatibility to discriminate between self and non-self pollen grains in other species the male and female parts are morphologically separated developing on different flowers
=== fertilization and embryogenesis ===
double fertilization refers to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary this process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure) germinates and grows a long pollen tube while this pollen tube is growing a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus the generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells as the pollen tube grows it makes its way from the stigma down the style and into the ovary here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells) the synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell producing a diploid (2n) zygote the second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei producing a triploid (3n) cell as the zygote develops into an embryo the triploid cell develops into the endosperm which serves as the embryo's food supply the ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed
=== fruit and seed ===
as the development of embryo and endosperm proceeds within the embryo sac the sac wall enlarges and combines with the nucellus (which is likewise enlarging) and the integument to form the seed coat the ovary wall develops to form the fruit or pericarp whose form is closely associated with the manner of distribution of the seed
frequently the influence of fertilization is felt beyond the ovary and other parts of the flower take part in the formation of the fruit e.g. the floral receptacle in the apple strawberry and others
the character of the seed coat bears a definite relation to that of the fruit they protect the embryo and aid in dissemination; they may also directly promote germination among plants with indehiscent fruits in general the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination in this case the seed coat is only slightly developed if the fruit is dehiscent and the seed is exposed in general the seed-coat is well developed and must discharge the functions otherwise executed by the fruit
== economic importance ==
agriculture is almost entirely dependent on angiosperms which provide virtually all plant-based food and also provide a significant amount of livestock feed of all the families of plants the poaceae or grass family (grains) is by far the most important providing the bulk of all feedstocks (rice corn maize wheat barley rye oats pearl millet sugar cane sorghum) the fabaceae or legume family comes in second place also of high importance are the solanaceae or nightshade family (potatoes tomatoes and peppers among others) the cucurbitaceae or gourd family (also including pumpkins and melons) the brassicaceae or mustard plant family (including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species brassica oleracea) and the apiaceae or parsley family many of our fruits come from the rutaceae or rue family (including oranges lemons grapefruits etc.) and the rosaceae or rose family (including apples pears cherries apricots plums etc.)
in some parts of the world certain single species assume paramount importance because of their variety of uses for example the coconut (cocos nucifera) on pacific atolls and the olive (olea europaea) in the mediterranean region
flowering plants also provide economic resources in the form of wood paper fiber (cotton flax and hemp among others) medicines (digitalis camphor) decorative and landscaping plants and many other uses the main area in which they are surpassed by other plants namely coniferous trees (pinales) which are non-flowering (gymnosperms) is timber and paper production
