applied mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical methods that find use in science engineering business computer science and industry thus applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge the term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models in the past practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake the activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics
== historyedit ==
historically applied mathematics consisted principally of applied analysis most notably differential equations approximation theory (broadly construed to include representations asymptotic methods variational methods and numerical analysis) and applied probability these areas of mathematics related directly to the development of newtonian physics and in fact the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century this history left a pedagogical legacy in the united states until the early 20th century subjects such as classical mechanics were often taught in applied mathematics departments at american universities rather than in physics departments and fluid mechanics may still be taught in applied mathematics departments quantitative finance is now taught in mathematics departments across universities and mathematical finance is considered a full branch of applied mathematics engineering and computer science departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics
== divisionsedit ==
today the term applied mathematics is used in a broader sense it includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as cryptography) though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics per se sometimes the term applicable mathematics is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today
there is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time and also by the way universities organize departments courses and degrees
many mathematicians distinguish between applied mathematics, which is concerned with mathematical methods and the applications of mathematics within science and engineering a biologist using a population model and applying known mathematics would not be doing applied mathematics but rather using it however mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics mathematicians such as poincar and arnold deny the existence of applied mathematics and claim that there are only applications of mathematics. similarly non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics the use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called industrial mathematics
the success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of computational mathematics computational science and computational engineering which use high-performance computing for the simulation of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering these are often considered interdisciplinary
== utilityedit ==
historically mathematics was most important in the natural sciences and engineering however since world war ii fields outside of the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics such as game theory and social choice theory which grew out of economic considerations
the advent of the computer has enabled new applications studying and using the new computer technology itself (computer science) to study problems arising in other areas of science (computational science) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example theoretical computer science computer algebra numerical analysis) statistics is probably the most widespread mathematical science used in the social sciences but other areas of mathematics most notably economics are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines
== status in academic departmentsedit ==
academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses programs and degrees in applied mathematics at some schools there is a single mathematics department whereas others have separate departments for applied mathematics and (pure) mathematics it is very common for statistics departments to be separate at schools with graduate programs but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department
many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications some ph.d programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside of mathematics while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application in some respects this difference reflects the distinction between application of mathematics and applied mathematics
some universities in the uk host departments of applied mathematics and theoretical physics but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics a notable exception to this is the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at the university of cambridge housing the lucasian professor of mathematics whose past holders include isaac newton charles babbage james lighthill paul dirac and stephen hawking
schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from brown university which has a large division of applied mathematics that offers degrees through the doctorate to santa clara university which offers only the m.s in applied mathematics research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include mit brigham young university also has an applied and computational emphasis (acme) a program that allows student to graduate with a mathematics degree with an emphasis in applied maths students in this program also learn another skill (computer science engineering physics pure math etc.) to supplement their applied maths skills
== associated mathematical sciencesedit ==
applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences
=== scientific computingedit ===
scientific computing includes applied mathematics (especially numerical analysis) computing science (especially high-performance computing) and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline
=== computer scienceedit ===
computer science relies on logic algebra and combinatorics
=== operations research and management scienceedit ===
operations research and management science are often taught in faculties of engineering business and public policy
=== statisticsedit ===
applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of statistics statistical theorists study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics and statistical research often raises mathematical questions statistical theory relies on probability and decision theory and makes extensive use of scientific computing analysis and optimization for the design of experiments statisticians use algebra and combinatorial design applied mathematicians and statisticians often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities)
=== actuarial scienceedit ===
actuarial science applies probability statistics and economic theory to assess risk in insurance finance and other industries and professions
=== mathematical economicsedit ===
mathematical economics is the application mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics the applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches mathematical economics is based on statistics probability mathematical programming (as well as other computational methods) operations research game theory and some methods from mathematical analysis in this regard it resembles (but is distinct from) financial mathematics another part of applied mathematics
according to the mathematics subject classification (msc) mathematical economics falls into the applied mathematics/other classification of category 91
game theory economics social and behavioral sciences
with msc2010 classifications for game theory at codes 91axx and for mathematical economics at codes 91bxx
=== other disciplinesedit ===
the line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside of the respective departments in departments and areas including business engineering physics chemistry psychology biology computer science scientific computation and mathematical physics
